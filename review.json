        "Context": "The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."

        "title": " Really Good End to Nolan's Great Trilogy\n",
        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'.\nThe new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure.\nThe best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'.\nThe writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture.\nHowever, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material.\nOverall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.9/10"

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "This is a strong and satisfying end to the Nolan Batman trilogy. While The Dark Knight was more complex, more intellectually impressive, and The Joker was a more intimidating villain, I thought this movie did better with cohesion, evenness of pacing, and overall felt like a return to the neatly packaged story of Batman Begins. In fact, with the number of parallels the story and visuals had to the first film were almost *too* on the nose, but I think it still worked (but did we really need that a whole flock of bats *and* the shot of Bruce Wayne's father coming to rescue him? Also, what was up with Qui-Gon Jinn's force ghost randomly appearing??). The cast was once again a solid positive for this movie. Hardy's Bane, while far less impressive and a little more cartoonish than Heath Ledger's The Joker, served his purpose. Oldman continued to do a great job and Gordon-Levitt was a nice addition to the cast. Morgan Freeman was sidelined once again, though, leaving this cast blindingly white except for a few background characters who die. However, this cast also had a significant improvement over the previous two instalments in the trilogy: While the death of Rachel Dawes may have left Gotham woman-less at the end of The Dark Knight, both Hathaway's Catwoman and Cotillard's Miranda Tate were strong characters who were prominent throughout the movie and important to the plot. Could they have been a little better in their execution? Yes, although they were handicapped from being introduced for the first time in this movie compared to the men, and I thought the two added much needed balance to the cast's diversity as well as its motivations.There was more heart in this than the previous two films, and it leaned into its emotional beats particularly in the ending. I would have liked more emotion throughout the series, and in contrast to the rest of this series the epilogue felt a little bit cheesy. Still, though, maybe that's okay. This movie did its best to earn the heartstring-pulls at the end, and it was certainly an emotionally satisfying and uplifting end to the trilogy."

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!Lately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes \"There is \"Whatever\" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end\". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was \"Out of the box\" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.The movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.At first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.The second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.My favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening \"Plane Hijack\" scene, the \"Stock Exchange\" scene, and \"Bane vs Batman\" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the \"Football explosion\" scene, \"Bane vs Batman\" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.Final thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way! Final Rating 9/10."

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "The only way to truly appreciate this film is to realize that like Kill Bill 1 & 2 which is one story, The Nolan trilogy is one story, you cannot assess this movie without seeing it as a continuity of the previous two. Eight years in seclusion, the greed of a few men and quiet streets allowed for a terrorist takeover of Gotham. A hidden lesson to current urban centers that regressed rapidly into anarchy or high levels of violent crime because of generalizations and the irresponsible media's ability to not isolate disturbing isolated events but to create further stereotypes and group incidents of rotten apples and broad stroke it to every law enforcement official in the nation...but I do not wish to digress.\nThe end in classic Nolan fashion leaves one wondering, is Alfred having another fantasy at the cafe, is the Bat Light real or the hope that Gordon can't let go off, the same with Mr. Fox.\nPeople will complain, no Riddler, no Penguin, no Poison Ivy etc....But this trilogy was for the audience that grew up on Batman geared for kids to Batman despite dressing up like a Bat....deals with issues of human nature, what is good what is evil...the distinction between the levels of good and evil....How the Protagonist and Antagonist deal with the same Trauma of parental loss. Is Batman simply carrying on what he learned from his father that in the right circumstances and obstacles removed people are good and capable of penance, or is their strict judgement and once condemned then condemned.\nIt also addresses or invokes free will vs destiny, and choice vs Cause and effect.\nI saw each in the theaters, and was even more satisfied watching them consecutively.\nRegardless of the Genre Nolan has dealt with these principles in all of his films..including Dunkirk in the scene where they discover one is French and the Brits begin the debate who should live or die...is this a war for the British or a war against forces infused with evil bent on the destruction of humanity. From a historical point of view there has never been a war that was so clearly one of righteousness vs the darkest aspects of humanity."

        "Context": "This will be a very underrated movie due to the amazingness of The Dark Knight. However, in many ways it is just as groundbreaking, philosophical, profound, and good as its predecessor. It won't necessarily surpass the masterpiece that the Dark Knight is, but it really comes awfully close. It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both."

        "Context": "Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

        "Context": "First of all, when I was in the theater watching (The Dark Knight) I said to myself that there's no way I'm going to miss the next movie in this series. after the epic nature and the overwhelming performance also the art of directing that makes you live inside the movie as we have seen in The Dark Knight, I expected this one to be at least the same level and I was absolutely correct. Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"

The Dark Knight Rises is the conclusion the trilogy deserves. Is it better than The Dark Knight? That's debatable. It's a very different type of movie.

        "title": " A masterpiece, a great finale for what may be the greatest trilogy of the generation.\n",
        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "First of all, the Dark Knight Rises in the concluding and final chapter in the critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan (Director) Dark knight Trilogy, and due to it being the predecessor to 2008's The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises was already overwhelmed with especially high expectations. However did it meet those expectations?(Spoilers!)The Dark Knight Rises opens with an overwhelming plane aerial action sequence, an the introduction of Tom Hardy's representation of the character of Bane. Tom hardy's performance as Bane is constantly stimulating, both visually and mentally, possibly as stimulating as Heath ledger's representation of the Joker in The Dark Knight, however I do believe that Hardy's performance is heavily tainted by the way in which the character of Bane was \"removed\" from the film, during the final act of the film. Among the incredible five star performances of the cast from Anne Hathaway in her fitting performance as Catwoman to the emotional performance of Morgan Freeman, the acting was a driving force in the film's outstanding quality. The intense, emotional performances were essential to the film's sharp writing, great pacing throughout the story. Christopher Nolan's incredible flashback technique used to compose an incredible plot twist during the final act of the Film. It has been constantly noted that the film has an extensive amount of plot holes, however after analyzing the story, I do believe that many of the plot holes mentioned are very pedantic methods used by fans of other blockbusters such as The Avengers, to better their personal opinions, rather than explaining what they enjoyed about their own personal favorite, they would rather slander and taint The Dark Knight Rises. However the film does have some relevant plot holes, which could have been resolved by additional footage, such as a director's cut or a three and a half hour edition of the film, I would have also been satisfied with a two part version of the film in which each part was two hours, or more in length. The film's combination of \"the chase\",and the \"the ticking time bomb\", during the final action sequence was an incredibly powerful sequence which kept me heavily invested in the outcome of the story, which climaxed with the most emotionally gripping moment in comic book film history, in my opinion. The supposed death of the Batman in the nuclear explosion, later denied by his alive appearance as Bruce Wayne, was a symbolic way to express how the death of Batman, allowed Bruce Wayne to Truly \"live\", while also leaving you wondering how he did it? Bruce Wayne's time in the underground prison was incredibly reminiscent of Batman Begins, as Bruce Wayne was forced re build his broken psyche, and truly become the Batman, physically and mentally; this also defined Bane to be both the greatest test for Batman mentally and physically but also the most important factor in Bruce becoming a truly righteous hero that Gotham deserves. And the final gift from Christopher Nolan the audience, was Joseph Gordon Levitt becoming the symbol of hope for Gotham as Wayne did in Batman Begins, leaving the audience understanding that the Batman is immortal in a metaphorical way, anyone with the will to do so can be Batman, in Nolan's cleverly and emotionally investing world. The Dark Knight Rises was a satisfying ending chapter to a greatly weaved masterpiece of a trilogy from start to finish. I would give The Dark Knight Rises 9.5/10, or an A+."

Did they exactly need a conclusion to Batman's story? That's really not for me to decide, but they did it and in my opinion it ended in the best possible way. Not the best way, but the best possible way. This is an excellent film, it is excellent because it demonstrates everything that made the Dark Knight Trilogy complex, and because of Nolan's direction it made it even better. Christian Bale gives a fine performance as Batman, the theatrical voice is still there, but it's toned down. I could barely recognize Tom Hardy as Bane, the voice is a little much but he still does good nevertheless. I really don't get all the hate for Anne Hathaway, she's a good actress, regardless of what her ambitions might be, she did good in Les Miz but did well here. Joseph Gordon- Levitt did good as usual, and Gary Oldman Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman can do this in their sleep. The Dark Knight was what it was because it had a realism to it, this could definitely happen in real life, in regards to the Joker. The realism fades when Bane comes along but that's not a bad thing if the story is told well (and it is).

There's romance, real drama and feeling, in contrast to the first two movies. Action fans will dig it, wingnut tech-heads will dig it. There's even a hint of the supernatural in this movie.

        "Context": "Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clich\u00e9s (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."

        "title": " The Dark Knight Rises: Ironically at the Bottom of the Trilogy\n",
        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "I have always been a massive fan of the Batman comics, ever since I was a child I was asking for the Batmobile for Christmas, and even though it's terrible I'm still a fan of the Tim Burton reboot. (Now you really know I'm a die-hard fan) But with all that said, there was something about The Dark Knight Rises that didn't feel right to me. Having seen it 4 times now I feel like I have a strong grasp on the entire film, and there are definitely some flaws that need pointing out, even though the majority of the film did leave me in awe. First of all I want to say that out of the trilogy; Batman Begins is my favourite. I love The Dark Knight, but it almost feels like 'filler' between Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises, in that there's no real story to it, it's just what Batman did for about a month that lead to Rachel dying. I loved Batman Begins because although it showed Bruce over a long period of time, it didn't really miss out any details. There were no stones left unturned, every story arc had an ending, every Christopher Nolan placed cheesy joke had it's minute, and even the ending wasn't as clich\u00e9d as it sounds on paper, even if I do hate it for making me wait 3 years to meet the Joker. But with all the hype leading up to 'Rises, I feel like an unobtainable greatness was expected by me and a lot of other fans, and so it would always seem worse than the previous two. That's nothing against Nolan though, 'Rises is a fantastic film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the only ending to a trilogy I have ever fully appreciated was Return of the King, but that's because it's such a masterpiece that the earlier films were dwarfed in comparison. So based on that 'Rises was destined to fail in my eyes.That said, there were still parts of 'Rises that are truly awesome. Bane, for instance, is one of the best villains I have seen in any film, game, book, TV show, advert, comic or dental commercial ever. He's just so bad-ass, even with the ridiculous voice and perfectly smooth head; Tom Hardy manages to present this 'don' of a character that even Samurai-flipping-Jack would be frightened of, and he does it all with the majority of his face covered up. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman also deserves much credit. The 'Halle Berry Catwoman' was bitter sweet for me and much of the DC fan base, it no-doubt was a very, very poor film, but it was sexy as hell, and this is where I saw Anne Hathaway going wrong; I thought she'd try too hard to make a better character than Berry and end up making a Catwoman that pasty teenagers around the globe couldn't \"enjoy\". But rest assured universe; she ticked both boxes. Hathaway ended up creating a character with such a sense of mystique around her that I think we all ended up wanting her to have more screen time, just so we could work her out, well that and her uh..'delectable posterior' (to put it nicely). On top of that, there are so many moments in this film that have you on the edge of your seat, making involuntary \"phwwoaaaaarrr\"-like noises. The bat-pods, for instance, are so much cooler than ever before, with the rolling-sideways-wheels and smashing into and through buildings. The collection of all 5 tumblers also had me giggling like a little girl, and even the small references to 'Killer Croc' made me grin uncontrollably.There are, however, some faults with The Dark Knight Rises that I feel need to be covered. A couple of them are just nit-picking; such as how in hell didn't the football player realise the ground had collapsed behind him? and how did Batman survive the nuclear blast if two seconds from detonation we saw him pushing the throttle forward?! Even if he had ejected immediately after he would have been able to avoid the blast radius. Some of the faults are more substantial though. For example I feel like bringing Ra's Al Ghul back into the picture with his daughter ruined things a tad, having Bane, the man exiled from the league of shadows for being too extreme is enough I think, as they don't really deal with Talia after she escapes, they just kill Bane and dispose of the bomb. Secondly, I feel there were a few too many plot twists for the story to flow properly, I mean come on Nolan; It's the end of the best Batman trilogy ever made; you don't have to keep throwing in changes to make sure we don't get bored. Hell, the majority of us are going to love it even if it's awful.Overall though it's extremely important to remember that this movie is the 'cat's pyjamas', and will probably go in for an Oscar or two if the academy don't act like idiots (again). Bane is one of the best written, most quotable character's of any film I've ever seen, and Bale really comes into his own as both Batman and Bruce in this third and final instalment (he tones down the Batman grumble, and doesn't make Bruce look like such a pansy anymore). So really disregard what I've said above, it's a fantastic film and I'm sure it will be a lot of people's favourite of the trilogy, just not mine. Go out and make your own opinion on it, because it's another of these films that come around once in a while where a review or general rating isn't able to truly determine how great it really is.

        "Context": "When Batman begins first came out I wasn't sure how you could do any better than the first Michael Keaton film. How wrong I was! Nolan has done a fantastic job reinventing the series, The sequel was almost as good as the first and gave us an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger which will always be remembered. So he had to get it right again and once again he does not disappoint.There was always a worry for me that putting Catwoman into a comic book film that Nolan has really tried to keep as realistic as possible would add a camp over the top element to it but Anne Hathaway played it brilliantly and looked stunning in the tight leather outfit, I would have said cat suit but it's only hinted as one with a clever use of glasses for ears.Tom Hardy was great as ever, he even managed to show his emotions through a thick mask. Once again another incredibly memorable bad guy has been brought to us. My only criticisms would be that occasionally it was difficult to understand what he was saying, I found myself having to really concentrate hard to follow the dialogue. Also without giving anything away he goes from a menacing, very intelligent force to be reckoned with that was always one step ahead of everyone, to a basic vulnerable thug quite quickly and I feel such a great character deserved a better finale.I also found that if I thought too hard about what the overall logic behind the city destruction plan was there were several plot holes.....but this is not based on a true story and there was nothing too obvious to take you out of the action so it really didn't matter too much.The film is quite long but moves at a relentless pace, with Hanz Zimmers pounding soundtrack to keep us gripped along with some incredible action scenes, sit back, switch off and let Bane and Batmans clash unfold in a nicely wrapped up ending to a fantastic trilogy, it's just a shame it's all over."

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "\"You are in for a show tonight!\" The dark knight rises one last time to save Gotham. This movie portrays batman at his most fragile self. Problems are everywhere while solutions in the abyss. Bruce is down with grief, Wayne empire is at all time low, Bane and his gang is taking over the city brick by brick. Bruce is faced with a choice to let Gotham die or rise to give some hope to its citizens who are interested in only one thing that they do best when threatened: own survival.This movie is a perfect blend of, pain, struggle, sadness, suspense, action, loss, chaos, triumph, powerful lines, a number of great performances and above all a very good story.Out of so many good ones if I need to choose a single stand out performance it would be Christian Bale, he has come a long way. This movie gave him a real chance to show what he is capable of as Bruce Wayne. Then comes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, reviewing their performance would be like holding a candle to the sun so I won't. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ann Hathaway were perfect for their parts, I was a little doubtful of Hathaway but she managed to steal the frames a good number of times. While I missed a mind blowing performance like Heath, Tom Hardy as Bane managed to deliver a handful of terrifying moments and last but not the least what a great music.A tiny issue I had was that first half took a little while to come to speed, but I guess it was necessary to build the story and to tie up the loose ends from last two parts.No amount of words would be enough to praise Christopher Nolan for giving us a stellar finale.My Rating: 9/10"

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "Is it a perfect film? No. It is a great blockbuster? Yes, it is. Tonally, The Dark Knight Rises rises above its predecessor in the trilogy, because it manages to balance the grounded in realism and comic book aspects into a tonally coherent work. In fact, though it still attempts to ground itself in reality, this is the most operatic and most bombastic of the Batman films. And, dear lord, does operatic work with the superhero genre. After all, at its true core, Batman, and the superhero genre, is inherently a ridiculous concept. I loved the ridiculous voice of Bane and Michael Cain's constant hamming it up, crying speeches. In recent years, the JJ Abraham's school of film-making has gained currency. The film moving so fact to one scene to the next that the audience barely has time to register the illogical steps taken by the characters. This is evident in the 2009, Star Trek film. While Nolan does this, he does it with so much more panache that it transcends the narrative, editing weaknesses associated with this modern form of film- making. The Dark Knight Rises is a pure cinematic experience. It is a film that needs It is a film that needs to be experience in the big screen. Even the hand to hand fighting sequences-- an area that Christopher Nolan has struggled with in the past -- are exemplary; they are reminiscent of the slow light saber fights in the Old Trilogy. The biggest problem with the film is that it does not developed the relationship between Marion Colitard's character and Bruce Wayne well enough; it feels too force. Another major problem with the film is the Howard Hughes segment, it which it is they only portion of the film that drags."

I would call the same casting on and on for more adventure.Bane is not my favorite character by far (really not interesting, just a tough guy) but all participate intensely and have a role and feed the story. The casting is incredible: Batman Begins + Inception + Anne Hathaway (she's such a complete and lovable actress and person)I just got the 2 DVD collector edition in Switzerland yesterday. I definitely recommend watching the bonus features, they explain a lot about the concept behind this movie and the connection with the beginning of the story.An amazing production, screenplay, performance !And yet: The whole experience was so different than on big screen. \"Duh\" you might say and still... let me explain myself:I recognized that some parts are only effective if you watched the film only once. This doesn't necessarily happen with other masterpieces I can watch on an on.When I watched all the interesting bonus features on the second DVD, I started noticing that from many multiple shots (shots filmed from many angles at the same time) the choice of those shots used for the movie weren't the clearest, or the most astonishing. So may things are finally not so clearly seen in the movie. There were many other successful angles that could have been used more effectively.Music soundtrack ? Hans Zimmer did a nice job but I would have preferred James Newton Howard.The fights weren't that clever, too tough and bulky, not necessary, no intelligence around them, plain fist. Not my port of call.Thank you Christopher Nolan for being clever enough to participate in the cinema industry and still deliver ART.Definitely a realistic, surprising and enjoyable film Thanks to all reviews and commentaries.A.real"

        "Context": "After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense\u0085 and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne\u0085 the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority\u2014forget the Bane you saw in \"BATMAN & ROBIN\". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.**** (out of four)"

Then after my huge expectations for, \"The Dark Knight\", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, \"The Dark Knight Rises\"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum. In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10\""

        "Context": "I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough.

        "Context": "Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake. Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead \"enforcer\", but one of the criminal masterminds behind \"Gotham's Reckoning\", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role. If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary. I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.10/10"

I highly recommend seeing the first 2 films in order to fully understand the emotional depth of this film (as well as plot points from the previous films). Yet, on its own, it's still an epic piece of cinema. This film clocks in around 2 hours and 45 minutes. It's the longest of the trilogy and not a second is wasted. All the technical brilliance and emotional core of the last films are turned up to eleven in this film. The best scene in this film isn't even an action sequence (although the action sequences are gritty as hell and the practical effects are Viagra for the eyes). It's the scene with Bruce Wayne listening to Alfred's story. It's shown near the beginning of the film and is still sticking with me. Second best scene is the ending. It's so damn perfect. It also just occurred to me how wearing masks is a theme throughout the film. Didn't realize that before. I love Bane. He's one of my favorite villains from any movie. The Joker still holds my number one spot simply because of his motivations and how his character is written. That being said, Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is a close second. He reminds me of a corrupt politician. This might have been intentional but what he says and does in this film is sometimes true in some sick way. Oh yeah, the scene where he craws out of the pit. Probably one of the best scenes from any film ever. He climbs without the rope and let's fear back into his life. This is shown when the bats come flying out of the wall. It's just an absolutely amazing scene that...GOD! I love it. No real complaints, I would have liked to have seen him with a little more time in the Batsuit, but I know this story wasn't just about him being Batman. I apologize that this isn't a well thought out review. Every single time I watch this trilogy, particularly this film, I'm left speechless. There're maybe one or two little things that bother me, but the overall experience of watching this is something that cannot be matched. I wish I saw these films in theater because if I had, my appreciation for them would have been different and much greater than what they are now. Batman is my favorite superhero and these films have done the character justice. The trilogy is over, but the legend lives on."

If you are looking for Batman, you will be disappointed as he is scarcely in the film. The first half is particularly dull and could have easily been edited down drastically to ease some of the pain. The pacing picks up in the second half, but unfortunately, so does the absurdity in the plot. The motivation of the villains is never explained in anywhere close to a satisfactory manner and their actions defy all logic. The ending is particularly laughable and even embarrassing to watch. Nolan fans who claim that these Batman films are somehow rooted in the real world aren't really paying attention. This film is every bit as bad as the Schumaker films, worse because this takes itself seriously. THE DARK KNIGHT probably stands as the best Batman film to date despite it's own flaws. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this mess."

He was a bad actor, extremely hard to understand at times, and added little to the movie. In my opinion, all of the acting was atrocious. Furthermore, I know it's a batman movie but I've never seen a movie that consistently had so many unrealistic aspects. I don't want to give away anything, but over and over again the most ridiculous incidents and scenes occurred. It was almost like a 12 year old with no sense of anything realistic wrote the movie. By far the worst Nolan movie I have ever seen. It's truly a shame the third part of the trilogy was so poorly written, filmed, edited, and directed. I don't know how anyone could rate this movie a 10. I went inwith low expectations because the first Dark Knight was so good and I knew this one would not be nearly as good. The movie didn't ever meet my meager expectations. It was truly awful, not even worth the price of admission."

Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is. Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie. And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible. The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie. Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS! 1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a \"real world\" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end. 5. \"Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.\"6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing. All and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap."

The messy plot, all the logical faults, the soft comments where to sacrifice oneself for the city of Gotham, the tears, the worn out wisdom of the wise-man in the cave.

The character of Bane, sounding funny, with no expressions at all, with this funny, performance-limiting mask, was huge disappointment for me. The movie lacks the involvement of Gotham's people, lacks the outstanding joker craziness yet somehow brilliant approach to bring the dark side in most innocent of Gotham's, and the Gotham's finest, and bring them to uncontrollable chaotic madness. It is an expensive movie, I'l give you that, you can feel it all the way, but that wasn't even close to good enough.

Bane takes advantage of it and warps it to his own cause. Bruce Wayne, a rich man that is above the law, shuts down Bane and prevents the people from airing their grievance, punishing them for it.So, doing the Nolan fan, \"everything is far deeper and more profound than it seems\" thing, it's really a movie about the richest man in a city keeping the people of the city in their place.Now, dropping the \"you have to read into it thing,\" the movie was awful on plain movie merit.It suggests all cops are idiots, having trapped an entire police force, because, you know, they wouldn't leave a single cop on the streets.The federal government negotiates with terrorists and pretty much gives them anything they want.Bane is just a cardboard cut-out of a villain. They try to develop him, but never really come into any depth greater than a tea spoon.A few push-ups can heal a broken back.Most of the established characters...completely ignored or simply paid lip service.And the list goes on.Ultimately, it is a disjointed mess. But if you look at the trilogy as a whole, Bale didn't make a very good Batman nor a good Bruce Wayne and the first one was decent, but no where near as great as everyone says it was. Really, it was Heath Ledger that made the second movie great, and the third just crumpled into dust.If you don't think about it too hard, it is sort of easy to ignore the distracting crap that goes on. But really, it takes a lot of effort to shut off you brain that much. Most of the time, you want to yell \"what the heck!\" at the screen like an armchair quarter back that just watched his favorite team give up an easy win.And this is without getting into the comic book nerd problems with it.As a comic book nerd I had issues with the Tim Burton ones...but those were a thousand times better and looking back the best Batman movies to date.Honestly, don't believe the hype, the Nolan trilogy has a single good movie in a mess of three sub-par films.You don't have to be a drooling and devout fan.

        "Rating": 1,
        "Context": "From the beginning, I have appreciated \"the crime epic\" or \"the crime saga\" approach of the director towards Batman, despite I don't stick with realism in cinema, however in this movie, Nolan goes too far and we watch a movie which has almost zero effect on the audience as a Batman movie! What Roland Emmerich did in 2012 is what Nolan did in this movie! I don't pay to watch a crime film without Batman! In TDKR, Batman is like a metaphor, yes believe me, in the first half (80 minutes approx.) we watch Batman in only one or two scenes and the part (the chase) was may be the best part of the movie! As some other moviegoers said, it is all about story telling with no break, but no break! You can't feel the film, because it is like you have no time to do that! How can I say, the movie is exhausting, you feel exhausted, yes that's the word! And if you suppose that in the second half, Batman rises immediately, my answer would be not exactly! As said, TDKR is about Bruce Wayne, other characters, themes, but not Batman! Therefore I felt cheated. And I always think that Mr. Nolan is not a good action director. In the first half, Batman has an interesting gadget, I have no idea what was the function of it, but he doesn't use it! So? Yes, the movie has plenty good action, it has its moments, but I can't say it is great! Nolan shoots chase scenes, in all of his Batman movies, there is chase sequence, but is this enough? There are some other type of action in TDKR, but don't expect an action-packed! (I'd expected) There is no character development for new characters except for Bane. As for Catwoman, Catwoman is not even spelled in the movie! Was she really Catwoman? What was her motivation? She was not a dominant character as it should be! Even the introduction of the character was poor! And she could have been sexy! We can't see even her body! A different interpretation? well, the problem here is Nolan doesn't care about the characters, it was the same in Batman Begins (Scarecrow) it was the same in The Dark Knight (Batman himself) He just puts a character forward, Catwoman, a burglar, OK next! Miranda Tate, a business woman, OK next! Something like that. John Blake is a well written character, a cop, at least he has a motivation! However, for example Miranda Tate is out of place! It feels like Nolan likes Cotillard and wants to work with her, they know each other from Inception etc. Mrs. Cotillard is a very beautiful and talented actress, but in this movie, she is just out of place. Bane is the scene stealer, the performance of Tom Hardy is great, his voice is brilliant, he is evil, he is bad-ass, but he disappoints because of two reasons: first, as you know too, in Nolan's story, Bane doesn't use steroids or he isn't exposed to poison known as venom, so he doesn't grow bigger. Second, the twist at the end ruins this character very badly and there is a scene which you feel like he is a henchman! And wasn't Bane big like in the comics in the teaser trailer? Was I cheated again? The final parts which are called climactic by a lot of people were not that climactic and there is nothing different or original! I expected to be amazed, surprised etc. but it didn't happen. This is a cold movie! The movie has not any impact on you, you can't feel the film, almost zero emotion throughout the film (like Inception) but except two part! The fight between Batman and Bane and the chase in the first half! If the whole film had been like that, I would have given 100 out of 10! The cinematography and the art direction are not dominant like The Dark Knight, the editing is like non-stop events with no break (now joke time! the only break was the regular 10 minutes break in the middle of the movie!) Also the film was too noisy at times. I didn't find the movie overlong, but what I get bored was watching a Batman movie without Batman! I found Batman Joker showdown in The Dark Knight anti climactic, low key and short, but this time it was much worse! That's why movies like Terminator 2 are masterpieces, am I wrong? You can't imagine how it ends! I almost found it ridiculous! TDKR is not a \"rich\" film especially in the content, so it is like \"poor man's Batman movie\" Personally my another problem with TDKR was it has zero \"comic book feel\" At least, TDK had it at times! After some statements of Nolan, the fate of John Blake made me laugh! Miranda Tate's climactic plan was boring and how can I say? it had no excitement or tense, because it was simple and clich\u00e9? Especially for such an \"epic\" movie! Doesn't this epic final deserve originality? By the way, Nolan doesn't even know how to shoot a snowy scene or he just doesn't care about it! Another problem, the mystery and suspense in the trailers were missing. And realism doesn't mean that the movie is deep or in comparison with other super hero movies, it is deeper, No, No! That's because Nolan is not interested in characters, instead he is \"event driven\" And couldn't the war between Batman and the other bad guys (the chaos) be handled better? The only good thing about this movie for me was Nolan avoids \"crowd-pleaser humor\" in this movie! The Dark Knight Rises may be a well made film, but as a \"Batman\" movie, it is quite empty."

The first is Batman's redemption and Reputation and the second is Catwoman's internal moral compass.The problem for me was that I can find no more than one significant turning point on each of these three plots. On the main plot. Bane goes from triumph to triumph as he enslaves Gotham with no disruption until the end. Similarly, on the Batman Reputation front, it is in the trash until he saves the city at the end. Finally, Catwoman is morally corrupt and betrays Batman ... until the end when she and the whole story turns around on one blazing action packed sequence.

The last one is in the series is mean to be the best but this was the worst - the batman series has been totally exhausted , there was nothing original or exciting in the whole film. The whole film is cheesy, i went with my friends who love the other batman films and not one of them like this.Forget the 10 star reviews this film is Boring and cheesyThe only redeeming feature is cat woman is sexy but overall the film is so slow and drawn out."

However, on this occasion I feel compelled to warn as many movie go-ers as I possibly can! I loved the first two Christopher Nolan Batman movies, however words fail to describe the clich\u00e9 filled popcorn piece of crap that is number three.I have absolutely no idea why this movie gets so many tens on a movie site like IMDb. I would have given this movie a 6, for the okay action scenes and the good (as always) performance by Joseph Gordon Levitt. However the overall score should be A LOT lower, so therefore my 1.So, what is actually wrong with the movie? There are about 426563 plot holes in the movie and the story line makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I won't go into detail as not to give away any spoilers. I am sure that reading this review will not stop you from seeing this movie. Since it's a so-called must see movie. But I implore you, go see this movie expectation to see a piece of popcorn crap, and you might be amused a bit. As for me, I would have like it better if the part after the break would have been a 5 minute Batman burial. Instead of another hour and a half rape.Enjoy!"

        "Context": "This movie was absolutely dreadful! First, it is much longer than it needs to be. There are many scenes that could have been shortened or cut out completely which would have had no effect on understanding the end or hurt character development whatsoever. The story is one of the weakest I have seen especially given how well the previous story line was in the last installment. There is very little action and what little there is just isn't worthy of the franchise or the amount of money spent making this film. I found myself constantly saying \"Get to it already\" and found Bain to be an almost silly villain. The cartoonish quality of the mask he wears is distracting and the cultured voice was ridiculous sounding. In all honesty he came off as a very obvious recreation of Lord Humungus from the second Mad Max movie (A much better movie than this mess and that's saying something). If you put a mask on someone covering only their mouth and nose and then watch them talk you should still be able to see movement of the face but not with bain. I was starting to wonder if perhaps he had pre-recorded the things he was saying as it didn't appear he said a single word throughout the entire movie. I realize this may be a minor issue but it really does distract the viewer. I wasn't able to invest in a single character and there were some pretty major holes in the story that really took away from the overall experience. I went into this movie with high hopes and lots of excitement especially after the performances in the last movie. Save your money and wait till this comes out on DVD so you can fast forward through the endless nonsense to the rare action scenes or at least turn it off after 30 minutes and only be out the couple of bucks you spent to rent it. What a disappointment."

I hope I was wrong so before watching \"The Dark Knight Rises\", I dusted off my old copy of \"Batman Begins\" DVD and gave it another viewing. Then I realized the reasons that I was not impressed when I viewed it the first time. In order to explain Batman's super power, Chris Nolan cooked up this Tibetan mystique ninja mumble jumbl which I found boring. Even the grand finale of the fight between Batman and his mentor seemed to be lifted right out from\"Spiderman\".After viewing \"The Dark Man Rises\", it is another evidence that when a filmmaker is given too much praise and power, he begins to believe it himself. In the old days, Hollywood had producers who exercised the check and balance on the script, the casting, the direction and the rest of the film production. When a filmmaker achieved successes and fame, he is given a free hand to make his \"Masterpiece\". The result is a dud like \"The Darkman Rises\". Just imagine all the money, time and talent being wasted, not to mention the time and money of the movie goers. Chris Nolan has yet to prove to be a film auteur or even a masterfilmmaker of blockbusters. Only technically proficient."

You can literally feel the disgust on Gary Oldman's face as he watches this \"acting\". Plot-holes are so ridiculous, I don't even know where to start: how does a nuclear bomb explode in a visible distance from a city and nobody gets hurt with a heatwave or radiation? How does a 12 million city has a single bridge of entrance? How does a handful of thugs run a megalopolis for months? Why does the main villain put the Batman, the prime target of her revenge, in a pit instead shooting him in the head? Where is that pit? How does a famished man with no money or other resources manage to magically appear from the said pit in a city surrounded by the the military on the other side of the globe?

But there's nothing to save this movie from Nolan's lack of talent this timeHere are the flaws already present in the previous movie that have not been corrected, or got even worse:-Batman's grunting, worse than ever. Jesus Christ you would think after all the mockery that's been done about it, he would at least try to improve that part a bit, but no it's actually more ridiculous than ever. - The music is omnipresent during the whole movie. It goes basically \"tchac boum tchac\" for all the movie, including the dialogue scenes. horrible artistic choice. - The action scenes, dull as hell. How can anyone fin this 'spectacular' is beyond me: there's no tension, intensity or drama in all of them. Nolan had too big a budget and decided to blow stuff up just for the hell of it.But there are new flaws as well! - The villain's motivations, which was what made the previous film interesting, are just completely incoherent! I won't say much more not to spoil anything, but believe me you just spend the whole movie asking yourself: why? why do this? - The villain himself. Without spoiling anything, let's just say all his back-story and charisma is destroyed by one silly, silly twist. - The villains' deaths have to be the most underwhelming I've ever seen. - The references about the current economic crisis: awwww look at these evil traders getting pointed a gun at, didn't they totally deserve it? Yawn. - The love interest. Wayne just randomly has sex with a woman he's barely met.

Unfortunately, thats about as nice as I can be with this flick, Anne Hathaway was absolutely ridiculous in her role, I still cannot even begin to fathom how director Christopher Nolan could try to make a \"down to earth\" style Batman and include such a cheesy character.The imagery in the third installment was incredibly bright considering the dark subject manner. I expect more from Christopher Nolan, for the cinematography in the first two chapters did Batman justice, while this one fell and looked completely bland and boring.The plot holes were many and the movie seemed to drag, almost as if Nolan was trying too hard to out-due his prior installments. A horrid display of an over budget, over zealous mess, that never once even hinted at anything remotely imaginative or new.If you like your movies ridiculously predictable and cheesy than put The Dark Knight Rises on your must see movies, if not, do what I'm going to do, wait for an adaptation of any of the Alan Moore or Frank Miller Batman stories (fingers crossed)."

My friends and I had high hopes and formidable confidence that the director would not let us down. Forty odd minutes in I knew something must be wrong. I was not enjoying the film. What was wrong with me? Over an hour passed and I still hadn't swallowed the pill that countless others had. It wasn't me; it was in fact the story. Or questioning lack of. Epic? Maybe in scale of extra's, explosions, soundtrack and length. Einstein's theory of relativity on excellent display here. I really could not wait for it to end. Then it did. For a moment anyway before it pushed up the Return of the King gear and overstayed its encore.Story, that which is so paramount in the first two of Nolan's take on Batman was lost completely in some terrible dialogue and loud explosions. I'm trying hard here not to put any direct spoilers in and ruin it for those yet to see the film, so you will obviously make up your own mind and really be disappointed like myself or see The Emperor's New Clothes.Minor characters from the first two films are either quickly pushed aside or ignored completely. One character in particular, one for the audience to connect with and our moral compass is lost to one half of the film. Greatly missed.Catwoman, beautiful and well enough portrayed by Anne Hathaway with what little story there was to work with, why was she there? The part could have easy been filled by any number of Banes associates be it the brains that pay him to be a thug or the brawlers who worship him.As for Bane, portrayed with such exuberance by Tom Hardy was the high point of the piece. I really enjoyed all his scenes and interactions with Batman. It's hard to find an actor who can convey so much through just with his eyes; Tom Hardy manages it with ease, giving a realistic frightening performance that demands attention.Again, I don't want to put any spoilers in so I'll wrap it up here. If you wanted to see an intelligent, thought provoking story in the ilk of the first two films you will be disappointed. Story and structure are forgotten and replaced with Michael Bay explosions and loud bangs. I have no problem against such films; I just didn't expect to find it here. I was bored and extremely disappointed, for me, there will only be the first two films. This will fall into the abyss with Die Hard 4.0 and Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. Oh, and Robocop 3."

But the problem is that he's a terrible writer. How many more times does he have to absolutely assassinate a perfectly good story idea or character franchise with his amateurish, ham-handed writing before he and everyone else realizes this? First, he always sets clocks in motion. Really? Is that all you've got? A real writer can create a sense of urgency based on time constraints without introducing an actual clock, especially one that is strapped onto a device that seems to have no other need of a clock than to display its imminent intent to blow everything to kingdom come.Then of course, there's character development, or the lack of it. Batman is conflicted as to whether he should be Batman or not. Bane is conflicted by, oh, let's say puppy love. Catwoman is conflicted by whether or not she really wants to be bad. I mean, I know this whole franchise is based on a comic book, but with a price tag of a quarter of a billion dollars to make, does it have to play like one? Come on, Chris. Hire a writer.Basically, this is a movie that consists of lots of scenes of people either fighting, or walking aggressively toward a fight, with the central characters standing still like a Greek chorus of narrators long enough to tell the story, rather than participate in it, by presenting long, boring diatribes and monologues like a bunch of kids breathlessly setting forth a cowboys and Indians scenario before they run around whooping and shooting, only to repeat, in this case for three tedious, exasperating hours.I love superhero movies when they are able, like all good science fiction, to transcend their admittedly contrived premises by presenting witty and profound issues in clever and unique ways without hammering you over the head or numbing your brain with endless sequences of violence and destruction.

        "Context": "CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT REALLY CARE.I rarely write reviews - but after watching the over-hyped brainwash epically named The dark knight rises - i felt compelled to do so.Beware this movie was dreadful in every single sense possible. Besides, it shattered an image of Christopher Nolan as such an outstanding director for me personally.1. Story This movie is a painful attempt to compress a ridiculously long story into a three hour running time. The basic idea to do so is a surefire way to failure. TDKR consists of a thousand cleverly mixed bits and pieces, which make the plot running, but at what price ? Pathetic plot holes covered with computer effects and glazed in \"epic-ness\", shallow characters, lack of logic, clich\u00e9 dialogs (to say the least). 2. Characters Where they came from? Who they are? Their motives? Their feelings? Their beliefs? You see nothing. Only hints. How do they communicate? They exchange clich\u00e9s and aphorisms. Gets on your nerves after watching half of the movie. Most reviews say that Catwoman was pretty good and believable, well, i just personally, do not stand women kicking ass - it's men prerogative.3. Batman Batman is not a Batman in it's traditional sense. Wayne overcomes eight-year depression in a couple of days and (wow!) he still is in great physical shape - and without any special preparation turns into a commando. He overcomes all the difficulties, out-plays the police, the military, the whole country, beats the bastards, rides the cool battleship - and saves the WORLD!4. Villain & the threat Bane visually was quite impressive, despite the weird voice, yet the context in which he was put completely diminished the power of a character. He safely lives under the city in the sewage, training a giant army ? I mean, one professionally trained police squad could stop him in real life. He walks around as if police snipers do not exist - just imagine him walking out on the stadium field in real life. Next moment you know it - head shot. Well, script writers thought otherwise. A reactor, which could be used as an atomic bomb? Built right under the center of the city? Oh, c'mon - how stupid is that? You can make an epic movie without a pretension for apocalypse. Miranda ? Who the hell is she - she appears a couple of times on screen and in the end turns to be the head of the whole operation. And what happened to the police ? Giant town is guarded by just a bunch (it is said 3000 people, but looks like no more than 50 or 100) of disorganized cops. Military guys looked even more pathetic.5. Emotions Movie tries to manipulate audience to experience certain emotions, but fails with the only exception - it really makes you tense at times. Romantic story between Miranda and Wayne looks more like a cold one-night stand. Sadness and parental love coming from Alfred towards Wayne seem so forced - i persuaded myself to believe it. Robin's background is not entirely explored and doesn't provoke that much empathy as the director probably have expected.6. Music I don't know who's responsibility is that - i believe an extra sound engineer for a movie would do the trick - the never-ending music just drowned out the voice all the time. With all the respect to Hans Zimmer, the accompaniment would suit a medieval battle movie much better.7. The \"Epicness\" Everything in this movie, starting from the setting and going up to the music is so overly EPIC - it just becomes plain boring after the second hour. Movie tries so hard to exceed all the expectations - it just becomes obvious. I would rate it two out of ten, just for the attempt and the amount of work involved into it's creation. Do not believe the hype!"

The rules about physics and the amount of power a human can have and others, just kind of got made up as the story progressed. Furthermore, I saw this at the ArcLight in Hollywood. A place known for it's great sound system and I could barely make out anything that Bain was saying because it sounded like Sean Connery speaking through a sub-woofer.The acting was SOOO bad by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway it's almost like they had no idea how bad they sounded or looked and Nolan just decided not to tell then about it. Gordon-Levitt is normally a great actor. I like that kid in pretty much anything he does, but watching him in this movie was torture, bad lines, horrible delivery. I would give anything to watch the movie while sitting next to him just to observe how he reacts to his own acting. I don't blame him, I blame Nolan. If you're going to introduce new lead characters into the story, at least give us a little insight as to where they've been or why they are the way they are.I'll just say that after sitting through the whole movie, I was reluctant but nevertheless satisfied with the more then obvious ending which was explained but did not need to be at all.

Bane was not the Bane from the comics, which was fine as he was reimagined to fit with the world of this trilogy, except that there was nothing particularly interesting about him. He has no duality, no depth, and no intensity. The plot was paper thin with holes big enough to drive a bat mobile through. Most actions of the bad guys, with some exceptions at the very beginning and very end, made no sense whatsoever except to give time for the good guys to come back and save Gotham from their vague idea of a plan. I kept waiting for Mr Incredible to pop up and make a joke about catching Bane monologing again. The middle act was a pointless return to the first movie where Bruce Wayne picks up yet a couple of more mentors to help him find his way yet again while the bad guys just sit around and wait for him to come back to ruin their plan which they could have finished at any moment after the first act. Catwoman was a bit out of place but was the only character portrayed with any depth and they beat you over the head with it in the repetitive dialog rather than let you observe the character evolve. OK, the new cop was alright as well, but his character growth was a bit forced. Scarecrow has yet another bit part like the second movie for cameo effect. The tech was alright as they give a nice intro to \"The Bat\" (-copter) but the exact timer on the unstable reactor was rather dumb. The very end was sappy cute, but predictable.Did I forget to mention Batman, fight scenes, and special effects? Well, there wasn't much of any of that, much worth mentioning anyways. Batman makes very few limited appearances as the movie focuses on his alter ego, and the fight scenes were few and lame. The special effects were both good and bad. The good is that they were well done and blended in with the reality of the movie very well. Bad in that there was nothing particularly interesting done. Chase scenes were short and simple, Gotham had little of the outlandishness of the first movie, and the masked characters spent most of their screen time without a mask - except Bane whose character had almost nothing done with the drug dependency.In all fairness, it is really hard to top The Dark Knight, but this doesn't even make a decent follow up. I'm starting to think that the greatness of the second film was all do to Heath Ledger's acting talent and nothing to do Nolan's directing. This movie also directly contradicts the second on in how badly it portrays the people of Gotham as completely selfish and the populous uprising was nothing but criminals, whereas the second movie had Batman's faith in the common man defeat the Joker's appeal to their selfishness, or how the second one had the criminals realizing when things went too far, but this movie made them mindless soldiers, or how the good cops in the second movie struggled with the corruption within the police force where some good cops went thuggish and even bad cops acted out of desperation rather than malice whereas in this movie all cops are so shinny good guys that even the most selfish moron on the force who puts his own career ahead of protecting the people gets hero treatment. The gritty lack of absolutes in any character that made the second movie so noirishly interesting dramatically was largely lost in this final one."

All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering.

        "Context": "This is not so much a comment as it is a letter to the Nolan brothers for whom I will choose to keep respecting albeit them having stolen almost 3 hours of my life and replaced them with over sized crap.I was incredibly motivated to watch Batman Begins (although I was not a fan of the \"original\" Batman movies) simply due to the fact that Nolan and Bale had grabbed hold of the project. I was not disappointed. Then the Dark Knight came up, and I was absolutely blown away. I decided then to keep some distance from TDKR so as to prevent it disappointing me, and now.. I just wish I had erased from my mind that this movie even existed.Mr. Nolan, I want my money back. The movie was an unbelievable shower of trailers at a nauseating speed and absolutely no regard for storytelling. The interpretations might be flawless but are as well a victim of this absolute rubbish screenplay which left me gasping for air after repeatedly having attempted to choke in my own vomit.Dear sir Mr. Nolan, this is misbehaving."

        "Context": "A hodgepodge of mediocre special effects, clich\u00e9, and sub-par acting, with an awkward and predictable plot.The only unpredictable part of the film is it's piecemeal nature: almost every character begins as one standard Hollywood persona and without motive changes to another clich\u00e9 at least once during the film. One can never know what is going to happen next since the sequence of events is only a random permutation of rote super-hero movie themes. The only certainty is that the next event in the chain will be as unimaginative and overused as the last.The sound quality is terrible (it is impossible to understand the villain or Batman at several points) and the pacing is awkward as the first hour covers plot over some weeks and the last hour covers the events over some months without indication.The finale is most disappointing of as the film descends in the realm of utter clich\u00e9, even corniness. The slightly surprising twist is once again completely non-sequitur and seemed to be thrown in as a cheap afterthought to give an illusion of depth to the movie. Of course what is one to expect when the villains are nothing but inexplicable anarchists with unclear motives other than a random desire to blow up the world. They are completely unrealistic as characters, as are the heroes.Strong points include Bane's voice (which though undecipherable is powerfully creepy), and a tastefully low use of special effects. This film is not a special effects orgy; the viewer is unfortunately confined to derive enjoyment from the plot."

NOT.the villain had an irritating voice of a very old and wise university professor , and even when he was standing away 50 feet, it sounded like he was talking right in your ear. is that genius or what ? i say bad job mister sound guy... he looked kind of stupid with that thing on his mouth, but i guess the movie makers had to come up with something original. it also seems this story had nothing to do with the original batman except for his cape , in that case they would have better came up with a new character . and leave batman for the fans. it is like blending seriously spider man or iron man in a scary movie script. a few might appreciate the humor, but it is kind of inappropriate.lets be honest , there were a few good parts interesting to see as well , but didn't save the crap . still waisted my time. i would not have miss anything by not seeing this movie. . and next time make sure batman fans are involved in the production.not just some big shot producer who doesn't care about whatever , just for the bucks. i say it didn't work out , despite the enormous financial success. it was the hype that did it , and batman's good name. i am not specific a batman fan , i just wanted to see a good movie. oh by the way , the end was kind of cheap as well. i started to dislike everything in this movie. 2 stars because i didn't turn it off halfway...(hoping for better)."

        "Context": "Granted, I found the first Nolan Batman to be overblown, dull, trite, and a bit silly (does Christian Bale really need to talk in the Batman voice like that? Thank goodness they made fun of that on South Park), and the second to be a bit better I suppose, but the third might be the worst of all. And the fact that there are those claiming it was \"perfection\" or \"flawless\" must have either seen a different film than I or are taking their job in the studio's marketing dept. way too seriously (most likely the latter).Let's forget Bale's awful voice work which has marred the entire Batman legacy throughout these three films (there continues to be one Batman and his name is Michael Keaton; I'd rue the thought of how the latter-day Burton would ruin the series further, but his initial two remain some of the last great masterpieces of commercial/studio film to be consigned to celluloid in the last era).Why did Bane need to sound the way HE did? I tell you, I'm not expecting cogent story lines or apt character development from a film like this or from Nolan, but as soon as Bane started talking in the first two minutes of the film, my girlfriend and I turned to each other and knew right away we were in trouble. Forgetting the fact he sounds like an arch-villain from an early 80s action cartoon (or an American Sean Connery, perhaps), whomever did the technical work on his ADR really dropped the ball. You can tell easily that his voice was incorporated into the soundtrack in a way wholly different from everyone else in the film. He sounds like he's talking in voice over the entire time. Yikes. If this movie gets nominated for Best Sound Editing, I'll know the Academy has absolutely no credence at all anymore.Other technical and editing faults spiral throughout the film. I blame Nolan again for this, as so many of the scenes in which characters are talking to each other are clearly edited poorly. Really took me out of the film. And, again, I'm not looking for artistry in a shoot-em up comic book movie made for acne-face'd teenagers, but one would think the filmmakers would AT LEAST get the spectacle/technical aspects of the thing right. Shame. Lazy work all around.The acting was, as usual for these films, subpar except for possibly Gary Oldman who for once didn't have a slew of clich\u00e9 comic book/TV lines to spout (\"Gotta get me one of THOSE!\" Yich). Then, of course, there's the many, many, many plot holes that are truly just befuddling. Namely the fact that we have an underground prison that is a central focus of the film and is supposed to be enshrouded in pure darkness, is to be \"Hell on Earth,\" and one of the worst -- if not THEE worst -- places someone can be exiled to... and yet whenever they show the actual place, it's well-lit and the folks who \"live\" there seem nothing but nice, as though inhabiting a communal little village in which you have doctors and gurus and mentors helping each other out. WHY is this place a Hell on Earth that would spawn \"pure evil\" like Bane? I couldn't figure that one out. (And without giving any spoilers, the way out of the place was so obvious -- even to the prisoners themselves -- that it makes one wonder why more of the prisoners don't just up and leave.)You also have the total unreality of a booming metropolis under complete lockdown for like six months and yet everyone still somehow has electricity, water, heat, food, makeup, clean clothes, etc. and even a relatively chipper attitude throughout? I would've thought Gotham would digress into Lord of the Flies pretty quickly, but apparently everyone just stays traditionally phlegmatic in Nolan's yawningly dull cinemaverse. (Not to mention a police force stuck underground who seem to be kinda fine with that after months of no light or clean bathroom facilities.) Sorry, there's suspension of disbelief and then there's just bafflingly lazy writing mixed with lobotomized audience members.As with the first Batman, I was also so incredibly bored for the first hour or so trying to stay awake for Nolan's signature needlessly convoluted, chaotically discursive, and haplessly disorganized \"plot\"lines that rather than being fooled like the illiterates who found this movie to somehow be better than Sunset Blvd, The Professional, or Once Upon a Time in the West according to the IMDb score they gave it, I knew -- yet again -- that Nolan is no genius but only a comic book enthusiast who thinks he's making a two-hour TV drama.And two hours were two hours too long here. Even when the movie finally picked up with some action about halfway through (aside from the loud and obnoxious first few seconds that might as well have been one explosion before moving into the doldrums for the next interminable sixty minutes), I had trouble keeping awake, wondering how much longer this seemingly five-hour marathon would go on for. Why didn't I leave sooner? Because $20 for an IMAX ticket is too much to step away from in this day and age and I thought MAYBE there would be some kind of pay-off in the end (there really wasn't; it goes pretty much where you think it would go). So, in conclusion: 1) Fair to poor acting, 2) Awful sound design and voice work, 3) Shoddy/lazy technical logistics, 4) Meandering and hopelessly disorganized script -- surprise -- 5) And, sadly for an action film whose one goal is to entertain popcorn flick style, BORING."

The action sequences are nothing special and some of the fight scenes are like watching fight scenes from an 80's A-Team episode.

The acting was phenomenal and that just doesn't cut it. True Dark Knight fans won't lie to themselves and pretend this was a good movie. I think Nolan tried to force an epic Dark Knight story into this trilogy and it just doesn't belong. I've read lots of the reviews of people calling this movie one of the greatest and claiming Bain to be one of the greatest villains and I challenge those people to try and sit through the movie again and see how quickly their mind will begin to wander.

Some people like Ann Hathaway's acting but there's nothing special about it, honestly. It feels like Chis Nolan has paid many of the reviewers here. Tom Hardy is a great actor but doesn't quite fit the character of bane. They should have picked up someone like Undertaker from wwe for Bane (someone at least 7 ft tall). Bane was very difficult to understand. (and I live in an English speaking country). even my wife couldn't understand him but was too embarrassed to admit until I mentioned it lol. The story is just weak. At one point it seems the movie is shot in 2012 but the flashback looks like its going back to 1700's. Miranda's story was just rubbish. At one point she sleeps with batman and 30 mins later she stabs him. Really? Mr Nolan? really? oh did I tell you Bane was killed by Celina Kyle (i.e ann Hathaway) and she did it quite easily with that Bat-bike (or whatever you call it). why didn't they just do it before. Guys please stop giving positive reviews just because this is batman. the movie is rubbish, in every way.

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clich\u00e9s, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze \"You're not sending me to the cooler\", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.Christian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.Overall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received.

Just look at certain interviews about how he portrays the character Bruce Wayne. It's almost as if Christian Bale does research and takes notes on Batman before he starts acting the part out. He makes all the right moves because he surrounds himself with a great group of actors. We can all relate to Bruce Wayne's character in some way and this is where we can thank Bale. Who else could've done it better? BATMAN IS BACK THANKS TO Christian BALE! I just hope the best is yet to come and he sticks with this role."

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "Batman Begins, the much hyped, much publicised 'reboot' of the Batman franchise is finally here and boy what a treat it is! I was a big fan of Tim Burton's take on Batman, his portrayal of the dark knight as a brooding and reluctant bringer of justice, I always felt fit perfectly with the imagery of the comic books and gave a great feel to the whole Batman mythology. The following outings of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, were less than splendid though. Over-blown campy nonsense with two-dimensional characters being upstaged by a campy over the top rouges-gallery of villains.So here is the re-boot. The beginning. Batman begins breaks from the convention of other comic book films. The first act of the film is told through flashbacks and does not follow a linear editing style. It gives a fantastic insight into Bruce Wayne's feelings towards his origins and his motivation for becoming the Dark Knight. It traces his path from young boy, to troubled young man; unable to vent the anger he feels for injustice he has suffered at the hand of the criminal element.Bruce Wayne attempts to confront his demons head on, but soon realises he is just one man in a corrupt and frightening world. The film takes us on the journey Bruce endures in trying to find what it is he needs to do to come to terms with his past and to guide his future. He travels the world and seeks out a means to better himself both mentally and physically. He trains with masters of martial arts, to learn the fighting skills and mental strength he will require to bring justice back to Gotham. This all provides the very convincing back-story of the transition from Bruce Wayne to Batman.Without giving too much of the plot away, Bruce travels back to Gotham and begins his quest for justice. It shows how he equips himself and the conflict he has within when dealing with the criminals of the city. It also shows what other Batman films have failed to show. The trouble of living a double life when you are a billionaire playboy. Bruce has to find balance between his public image as Batman and his public image as a rich, businessman and socialite.The film climaxes with an awesome final act, showcasing immense fight scenes, brilliant use of the new Batmobile, gorgeous sets and intense acting. The final scenes set the film up perfectly for any sequels and all the while maintains the sense of realism and down to earthiness that Nolan promised.Batman Begins is well written, well-shot and combines amazing special effects, set design and acting to form a perfect final package. This is without a shadow of a doubt, the best comic-book movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale puts in a sterling performance as Bruce Wayne, often reminiscent of his role as a businessman in American Psycho. He is also very convincing of a man driven to fight injustice, a man with a troubled past and a man seeking what he must do to come to terms with it. He is also entirely convincing as the all-action hero Batman, disposing of criminals with his expert martial arts training enthusiasm for justice.The supporting cast is perfect. Michael Caine is an inspired choice for Alfred. There is good chemistry between him and Bale and you are left convinced that they have a quasi-father/son relationship and that Alfred genuinely cares for his young master. Gary Oldman plays a brilliant Sgt Gordon, the last honest copy, torn between misguided loyalty to the force and an honest will to protect the innocent. Cillian Murphy plays a reserved, but entirely psychotic proto-super villain and Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, as always provide strong character roles. Holmes was a fine leading lady, but I couldn't help feeling she didn't really have enough to do in this film, however only a minor criticism.Batman Begins is a dark film, centred on strong themes of fear, over coming demons of your past and the fight for justice in a corrupt world. Unlike many comic book films, this film is not in anyway aimed at children. It is not strictly adult in nature, but follows intelligent character development, adult conflict and complex portrayals of the characters. Most comic book films introduce your hero as good because he wants to save the world and the villain bad because he wants to take over the world. Then the action begins. This is not the case with Batman Begins, it gives insight into each character's motivation and reasons for their actions, it does not expect the audience to blindly accept anything on face value.Well done to Goyer and Nolan for producing such an awesome movie. When I left the cinema, everyone in the audience was grinning at the end of the film, knowing they had just seen the beginning of something rather special. Bring on the sequels!"

A grand slam.The folks responsible for this adaptation of the Dark Knight simply \"got it.\" 100%.Batman is a persona that was created to inspire fear into the hearts of criminals. A creature of the night that hunts from the shadows, strikes without warning, and vanishes into the darkness like a nightmare. The character is never meant to be seen by the general public, he is merely meant to exist in their whispers, an urban myth that is talked about in hushed tones throughout Gotham City.Batman does not have a \"Bat Credit Card\", and he doesn't attend charity auctions or d\u00e9butante balls. He doesn't drive around the city streets in the Batmobile in broad daylight, waving to cheering citizens. He doesn't have a \"Bat Phone\" that connects him to the commissioner. He doesn't wear a costume with rubber nipples or operate vehicles with spinning neon turbine engines and open cockpits. He doesn't crack jokes like, \"It's the car, right? Chicks dig the car.\" All of these things are wrong, wrong, WRONG...and this movie understands that. It understands that and washes all of these injustices away until they are nothing more than a faded bad memory. Screenwriter David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan have given us a film that treats the character with respect; a loud, thrilling masterpiece that doesn't insult your intelligence or bombard you with inappropriate campy antics.Christian Bale gives us a Batman that will scare the living crap out of you. His voice is a gravelly, menacing sound, and when he yells at some poor schmuck to get some information, it's downright terrifying. He swoops out of darkened alleys, hitting fast and furious. He's brutal, cold, and calculating. In short, he's everything that anybody who ever put that cape and cowl on is not. Perfection.The villains are also amazing, but a huge part of their contributions to the overall brilliance of the film is their failure to dominate it. The previous Batman movies were plagued by these cackling idiots in ludicrous costumes who pushed Batman to the back burner. In Batman Begins, we finally get to spend some time with the hero, learning who he really is behind the mask.Not to imply that the villains are poorly fleshed out or inconsequential to the story - quite the opposite in fact. Cillian Murphy is a very effective Scarecrow, turning in a subdued, but intensely creepy performance as a warped psychiatrist who uses fear gas on his victims, unleashing horrifying hallucinations. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) is a shadowy Tibetian criminal warlord named Ra's Al Ghul, who watches over young Bruce Wayne's training with Ducard, played by Liam Neeson. But things are not what they appear with this situation, and a shocking twist comes into play towards the climax. The rest of the cast is solid, especially Gary Oldman, who finally gives us a competent, intelligent James Gordon. Essentially, the movie is about fear. Confronting it, learning from it, using it, and conquering it. It's a dark, serious film that leaves little room for humor, but some sneaks through in the form of some witty exchanges between loyal butler Alfred (a brilliant Michael Caine), and Bruce Wayne.This movie is awesome and a complete triumph for DC, Warner Brothers, Nolan, and everyone else involved.. Run, don't walk, to the theater. Amazing."

So i don't want to make this long.I went to the Wizard Wolrd Comic Con on Saturday June 4th and they had a special showing of Batman Begins at the IMAX theater in King Of Prussia. Well.. It was Awesome. I am a huge comic book fan and this made me very happy. It is on par if not better then Batman 1.The movie has a scene here or there that is only so so, but you forget about that by the end. Anything they change in history is easy to forgive too because it works so well and makes a lot of sense.All the actors did a great job. I thought to many big names would be bad.. i commend you ALL... i knew Christian and Gary would be perfect and they WERE.. Katie, Michael and Morgan i was worried about (no offense to them, just for the roles) and they did awesome. Katie Holmes actually really did a great job. I gained a lot of respect for her abilities.Overall.. SEE IT.. i would have been willing to pay so much to see it early and getting a free showing made it that much sweeter. I have to see it again on opening night and then a week later for my brothers last night as a free man.. and i cant wait... GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT.. well.. when it opens :) THANK YOU to all who made this movie happen.. you really gave a great film that will hopefully get the taste of the last two (i know.. new franchise) out of our mouths."

        "title": " The Best Superhero Film of the Decade ... so far\n",
        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "There is a moment towards the climax of \"Batman Begins\" which illustrates why this film is an exceptional superhero flick. During a stunning car chase sequence, Batman (aka Bruce Wayne), our hero, crushes a number of police cars, at the very least injuring a number of policemen. Once Bruce Wayne returns home, he is reprimanded for showboating by his loyal butler, Alfred. In this sequence, the strengths of the film are neatly summed up. An exciting chase sequence is mixed with ambiguity surrounding our protagonist with questions raised over what is necessary for good to triumph. Indeed, at some points during this film, we are left asking what is good and whether it is triumphing at all. In short, this film merges superb action, clever character work and intelligent moral and philosophical questions all the way through with perfect balance.During a decade where the box-office has been stuffed with super-heroics of all shapes and sizes, this film remains the best super-hero film of the decade, with the only imminent challenger to that crown seemingly being its own sequel. Even the \"Spider-Man\" films, which together with the \"X-Men\" films can lay claim to starting the major revival of the genre, are able to beat this. But the comparisons are strong and the influences upon each other even stronger. \"Spider-Man\" arrived in 2002 and boasted strong character work as well as blockbuster action sequences. \"Batman Begins\" was deep into production when \"Spider-Man 2\" arrived in cinemas in 2004 with even stronger and detailed characters, better visual effects and action sequences that were greeted with applause the world over. The bar had been raised by the time the Dark Knight's origins were brought to the screen a year later. Expectations were high and the pressure was on.Nolan had the guts to do what he thought was necessary to make the franchise credible after the disaster of Joel Schumacher's \"Batman and Robin\" from the late nineties. Out went the camp Batsuits and cheesy dialogue, the comical villains and supernatural design. In came a gritty, realistic Gotham with as much backstory as the central character and villains who were not cartoonish. This is a world that is not dystopian but downtrodden and at the centre of it is Bruce Wayne who we find in prison, a lost-soul.Nolan devotes a relatively action-free hour to the central character, his past and the genesis of Batman. He is trained with brutal methods, whilst we are slowly shown the origin of his fear of bats and the death of his parents. He faces questions of justice and identity before resolving to return to Gotham where he slowly confronts his fears, his guilt and his anger and becomes Batman.Once the suit is donned, the film hits top gear. The action sequences and set-pieces come thick and fast. We meet our villains (excellent performances from Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy), though the nemesis remains a mystery until late on. We discover the childhood sweetheart, now District Attorney, Rachel Dawes (a competent but unpopular Katie Holmes) and other lead good guy, policeman Gordon (another brilliant supporting performance from Gary Oldman), not to mention faithful butler and serial scene-stealer Alfred (long live Michael Caine). The philosophical questions, already established in the opening half-hour, are expanded upon (a detailed exploration of justice being the main one, with both protagonist and antagonist believing that they are carrying it out) whilst the world is filled in and Nolan's canvas expands.But the focus never shifts from Bruce Wayne, who is complex, interesting, sympathetic and expertly performed by Christian Bale. For all of the action (and there is enough of it, with none of it disappointing) the most enduring image is an astonishing shot of the Dark Knight silhouetted against the dawn sky as he stands at the top of the skyscraper surveying the metropolis below. It is a beautiful spine-tingling moment that, in an image, shows the strength of the film. This is an in depth exploration of a fascinating central character done with style and in a thrilling manner. This is not just the thinking man's superhero film. It is every man's superhero film with action and intelligence working together to brilliant effect.The bar had been raised once more and it became evident in what followed. About a year and a half after the release of this reinvention came a similar change of direction for the Bond franchise with \"Casino Royale\" followed shortly by a trailer for \"Spider-Man 3\" which seemed to be heading into ultra-dark territory. Spider-Man's identity and soul where going to be at stake, but the film itself failed to match Nolan's effort. In fact, in the attempt to raise the bar once more it fell well short of previous efforts.And here we are, three years later, with the sequel \"The Dark Knight\" about to be released, and still Nolan's film sits on top of the pile. Why has no-one matched it? Is it something to do with the character or the director that makes \"Batman Begins\" unique? The franchise is not unique, but the director is. All you need do is look at his other pieces of work (especially the intelligent \"Memento\" and the intense \"The Prestige\") to realise that Christopher Nolan is a director of great intelligence, ability and style. Another film like \"Batman Begins\" from another franchise is not impossible, it is just very difficult."

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "Batman Begins was a movie I liked marginally when I originally saw it, but have grown to like it better the more I see it. Christian Bale plays the renegade billionaire Bruce Wayne who mysteriously disappears for several years while studying the criminal mind and element in the Far East. He is found by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the League of Shadows. This organization uses Ninja tactics and sees itself as the guardian of the world. The League of Shadows exists like a Star Chamber, taking actions against criminal elements government courts will not deal with. This secret league was responsible for the sacking of Rome, and the London Fire. Now, they wish to level Gotham City. Bruce barely escapes after learning their battle tactics. Returning to Gotham, he dedicates himself to ridding the city of Falconi, a ruthless crime lord who has the city in his grips for decades. In fact, the man who killed Bruce's parents worked for him at one time, making the stakes higher. Wayne uses his clout to look into weapon systems his company developed. He find some body armor. An unusual car. A cape. He forges them all into his new persona, Batman. While he brings down Falconi, someone else gets to him first: Dr. Jonathan Crane or the Scarecrow, played by Cillian Murphy. His gas agent causes people to go insane by releasing their worst fears. Apparently, he is working with the League of Shadows and release his chemical into the drinking water. We also meet a young cop named James Gordon (Gary Oldman), who is trying to go against the crooked police department. Another player is Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), an attorney who works for the city. This is how Batman should have been. Director Christopher Nolan deftly puts Batman into the real world. While I enjoyed Tim Burton's concept for Batman and Batman Returns, it was foreign - removed from reality into an uncertain time with uncertain technology. What Nolan does is give us not only circumstances, but also consequences for a man driven to the edge. I also enjoyed his use of non-linear time, which he seems to be a fan of. It keeps the audience interested and puzzled until the third act when it truly unfolds and fully makes sense. Also, Chrisian Bale does a wonderful job as a man conflicted. He hates the criminal mind and believes they should be stopped. Still, he cannot bring himself to kill those he hates. He also deals with his own hatred and propensity towards vengeance. The other performers also give great performances. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the company man who leads Bruce Wayne to the interesting toys. He tells him how they work and how they should be used. Michael Caine gives the best performance as Alfred Pennwise, the faithful butler to Bruce Wayne. His charm, charisma, and dedication are portrayed so well. I was even moved by Gus Lewis as a young Bruce Wayne who took the role seriously and gave us a boy who truly blamed himself for his parents' death. The best scene is when Alfred comforts his loss. This was one of the best of the superhero movies of the last ten years. I hope the next one is done just as well."

        "Context": "Well, it's official. Batman has gotten his balls back. This film is dark, extremely dark. So dark in fact, there are a great number of scenes filmed, I kid you not, exactly like a horror film. Now, I'm a huge fan of the \"real\" Batman movies. You know, \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" which were done by Tim Burton, starred Michael Keaton, and were carried along by Danny Elfman's rousing musical score. Let's not forget, that old Batmobile from those films. This tank-like monstrous new Batmobile may very well be the coolest car I've personally seen in a movie in ages. Of course, if you're a fan of those rather putrid, embarrassing \"other\" Batman films (Forever & Robin), then you may very well not like this movie. Because it doesn't totally suck like those films did.Basically, this is the story of how Bruce Wayne thought of, created and became Batman. In a nutshell. However, it also tells, in the most personal way, of his struggles with the concepts of justice and vengeance. It shows us how he trained to become the ultimate fighter of evil and corruption. It introduces us to a different villain from the previous four films\u0097and does a mighty good job of it, too. Even as a side note\u0097we're introduced to good old Commissioner Gordon\u0097before he's police commissioner. So then, it also tells a bit of his \"beginnings.\" We see the beginning of the Batcave and find out just how Bruce Wayne was able to, to quote the Joker, \"\u0085get those wonderful toys.\" On top of it all, if you ever thought Michael Keaton was the only person who could adequately, correctly portray Batman on screen, you just may change your mind here\u0097I never imagined Christian Bale would do such a remarkable job.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The action is fast and brilliantly choreographed.--The dark mood is finally back\u0097the way Batman is supposed to be\u0097it has even less \"camp\" value than Burton's films!--The Batmobile, as I said, is incredible\u0097and has some great sound effects to boot. Supposedly, it was designed by the same person who created Keaton's Batmobile.--Christian Bale is so good, he almost causes you to forget about Kilmer and Clooney\u0097thank god!--Michael Caine's powerful performances\u0097he's the major player keeping Bruce Wayne's humanity in check. More so than Katie Holmes, whose performance, while good, was a tad weaker than Caine's in this respect. She did an interestingly good job as a tough lawyer, however.--Bits of comic relief here and there\u0097that don't ruin the movie!--Brilliant atmosphere.--Excellent acting all around.--Not claustrophobically over-crammed with \"Batman\" villains like the last two films. The only major villain is the Scarecrow, and another character whom I'll leave up to you other movie goers find out.--Excellent tension.--Fantastic cinematography.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music is good, but for those of you out there like me\u0097you may miss Danny Elfman's beautiful score.--Gotham City is not as Gothic as it should be. However, the film has slightly more modern twist that makes it more \"believable\" than the previous films. Especially those last two, which, if you haven't guessed it by now, I hated.--Early on, the story deals a lot with flashback sequences\u0097a couple are a bit confusing as to where they belong chronologically. They may have indeed been chronological, but only seemed like a steady story with flashbacks. Still, it gets the point across.--The film seems to be set-up as either a new Batman series, or a prequel to Tim Burton's original Batman. I guess I'd be happy with either\u0097so long as they keep Christian Bale and don't sell out to that campy crap again.The Bad:--Scarecrow seems a bit underused.--We had to endure \"Batman Forever\" before we got to this brilliant piece.The Ugly:--We also had to endure \"Batman & Robin\" before we got to this. \"Har har, ICE to zee youuu!!\" Ugh!Memorable Scene:--Batman and Scarecrow\u0097talking \"face to face.\"Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 (there is none) Violence/Gore: 8/10 (a lot of violence, yum yum) Dialogue: 9/10 Music: 8/10 Direction: 10/10Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10I finally went with a \"9\" over a \"10\" for these reasons alone: Scarecrow, to me, was a little underused; and I missed Danny Elfman's music. If you loved the first two films, you'll love this. If you loved the third and fourth films the most, well then, you sir, belong in Arkham Asylum and apparently hate movies.

Sir Michael Caine as Alfred was something I couldn't see working before the film but him and Bale played off each other well and created the best character interaction.Katie Holmes was also surprisingly good but unfortunately the chemistry between her and Bale seemed non-existent really which is a bit of a shame.The major injustice in this film is that Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow has such a small part as the villain.

While Hulk failed on every conceivable level, though, this \"Batman\" succeeds.Although comparing Burton's Batman to this one is an exercise in tedium (both are great movies, although they satisfy different types of moviegoers), it may be enough to say that, while Keaton portrays Burton's Batman, Christian Bale is the comic book superhero. Keaton has an edge while showing off Bruce Wayne's strange and weird attitude, while Bale is absolutely amazing while depicting Batman as a man, driven by rage and hatred, who is willing to die to find inner peace.The only weakness I could see was Gotham city. Burton's vision of a future / past Metropolis is unsurpassed - his dark, menacing city is oppressive and hopeless. The new city can't approach the old one's power.Strangely enough, I found the actual \"Batman\" scenes not as satisfying as the whole Bruce Wayne transformation sequence.

While Tim Burton's 1989 movie is already a box office classic, Batman Begins has all of the gritty power that made Batman famous in the first place. Chris Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Shumacher couldn't do, which is make a comic book film true to the actual comic. While Nolan's direction is amazing David s. Goyer's script is great. The film starts with a tortured Bruce Wayne traveling the world, when he meets his soon to be mentor Henri Ducard played by Liam Nesson. his training wins him a spot on Ra's Al Ghul's League of Shadows. Bruce decides to pass on the proposal and heads back to Gotham. Soon we see Bruce transform into a fierce hero bent on cleaning up his city.The film's supporting cast including Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine make Batman Begins far more than just a kids movie.

Christian Bale's Batman makes Ben Affleck's tortured Daredevil character look absolutely ridiculous (sorry, maybe that is really not giving Christian enough praise - he deserves all he gets). Since we are in for a few more years of comic books as movies dominating the scene, I vote for more like this - made for adults, not children, with superb casting, and Hans Zimmer (with the help of Lisa Gerrard, maybe Moby, and the like) scoring the music.

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "Christopher Nolan and crew are to be commended for a job well done. If you are moderately interested in Batman, perhaps enjoyed the first film or two but was appalled with Schumacher's take on the series, you will love Batman Begins for its return to the darker, more serious side of Batman. If you are, however, a true Batman fan (by that I mean you have read your share of Bat comics and genuinely appreciate the character), this film will blow your mind.First off, let me say that Goyer and Nolan do take a lot of \"artistic license\" with the origin story; though is such a thing possible with a story that has been retold countless times? Anyway, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into the mix of Bruce Wayne's struggle - and subsequently, a lot of dimension.The mission of Batman Begins is really very simple - to bring a sense of realism and maturity to the Batman tale.When I say realism, I do not mean it is realistic. How could it be? But the film approaches the subject with the question, \"Okay - what if it WERE possible?\" And the suspension of belief works well.But besides all of that, what is really important about this film? Christian Bale. He MAKES Batman work. Never before has any television or film truly captured the intensity, the ferocious growl, the unstoppable passion that Bruce Wayne has.And this is a film about Bruce Wayne, not Batman. Which is why it works so well.I think this film would not have been possible, perhaps, without Spider-man's birth to the screen. Spider-man revolutionized superhero movies, gave some credibility to them. It showed the world that, in order to make a movie about a superhero, you have to instead focus on the alter ego - the real person.But Batman is a little trickier than Spider-man, I think. You see, the twist to this character is that, the Batman IS Bruce Wayne. Wayne the billionaire is the mask. Perhaps this seems a little simple, but the film really takes a hard look at it, and shows us two different Wayne's. This Batman does not require his costume in order to be Batman.There's a wonderful scene that shows an interaction between a little boy and the Batman. Batman attempts to stay hidden as he clings to a building in an alley, spying on a villain attempting to get rid of criminal evidence. The boy emerges from his beaten down apartment, parents yelling at each other in the background. He looks out on his rugged balcony, then catches a glimpse of the Batman - right next to him. Instead of rushing off, Batman just kind of shares a moment with him, silent at first, and the boy says with hope, \"I knew you were real. No one else believes me.\" Bruce watches him a second longer, then hands him a device from his belt and disappears. This wasn't the cheesy, super-hero interacting with adoring fan type scene. It was almost like two kindred spirits, the hero feeling the child's pain and reaching out to him. The thing that is so wonderful about this version of Batman is that, while he appears heartless, he's actually full of compassion. And it isn't just the dorky super-hero type \"calling\". It runs in the family. We learn in the film that Bruce's great grandfather helped slaves escape to the North during the Civil War. We see perhaps one of the deepest renditions of Bruce's father, Thomas, as being a strong, compassionate and loving father, who's saying sticks with Bruce all his life: \"Why do we fall? So we can pick ourselves back up.\" Michael Caine does a riveting job as Alfred, much more masculine (in a gentlemanly way) than past incarnations, a bit more youthful and definitely more agile. His fatherly influence warms the heart and makes us treasure every second with the character (though it might just be because of Caine, who is a phenomenal actor). Think of a \"Second Hand Lions\" type Alfred.Then there's the love interest (if you can call it that), Rachel. Honestly, I understand why they put her in here, but she really has no point to the story. She's not the reason he becomes Batman. She doesn't stop him from being Batman. She's just kind of there, a convenient voice from the past. Really, any of her scenes (aside from the kiss at the end) could have been given to Alfred, and it would have worked better. But being that she's actually such a small part of the film, it doesn't bother me that much.I won't go into the villains, because I can't say much there without giving it away. I will say, though, that they are again, very much based in realism, not in comic color poetry. There are a wide variety of villains in this film, and at the end, the promise of one very special foe in the sequel.This film ends on a definite note of continuation, as even the main titles suggest it (the title \"Batman Begins\" doesn't even flash until the last scene has rolled). But it works, because you knew that was coming anyway, right? Personally, I feel this film is a much more mature comic book film than Spider-man, Superman, Fantastic Four, X-men, etc. will ever be. While not realistic, Batman Begins is BELIEVABLE, and I will definitely be frequenting the theaters quite a bit this summer to see this movie again and again."

The amazing thing about the Batman character over most other super heroes is that Batman has NO powers. He is just a guy, a rich guy yes, but not super human in any respect. Unlike Superman or most other titans, this guy can be killed and won't come back from the dead, of course the comic brings in new writers and they start another story line parallel for the character.Which is what Batman Begins is all about, a new take.I am a big fan of the Tim Burton Batman film. Batman Returns is a good movie, but it didn't work as good and wasn't as much fun as the first film. The Joel Schumacher films pretty much turned it into a ride at Universal Studios Orlando. Batman and Robin was a sad deprecation of a once great character. Bruce Wayne and Batman had only a small cameo in a movie that seemingly tried to fit every Batman villain in the past 30 years into some part.Thank you David Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Essentially they have turned Batman into a Michael Mann film. Batman Begins is the story about a man who has a tough job to do in a dirty place. He isn't a machine and doesn't live in a video game. We know why he does what he does. For the first time since the first Spiderman, we get an action movie that tells us why the character is in action. The insert scenes of flashbacks of Bruce with his father go a long way in adding up our main character.Thanks to a beautiful, forceful score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard the brood of Gotham and the force of the Batman character come to life in a big way.All the actors in the movie play their necessary parts and because they are all so distinguished, we never question if they are even necessary to the plot, frankly we don't care. All the actors are so good we want to see them on screen and just hang out. It is the same feeling I got when I was a kid watching Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, John Wayne and Walter Brennan sit in a jail and sing just to pass the time in Rio Bravo. Good work by all involved.Comparisons to the elder Batty film of 1989 will come up. Which one is better? Not sure, I think Nicholson was so dang good as Joker for me its a hard call to see anybody reprising that role. Overall I think both films compliment each other.Just as legends in history can be told and retold with pieces of the story changing every time, comic book stories that are so well grounded like Batman can be retold.The band may be different, but the song remains the same."

The thing is, this, and the rest of the trilogy, are not typical superhero movies. Christopher Nolan brings Batman to a whole new level with the trilogy, and Christian Bale is a stellar Bruce Wayne. As a Batman fan for life, I recommend this movie to any Batmen out there. But, if you are not a big superhero fan, this is a great action/crime movie for any fans of either genre. 9/10"

        "Context": "Okay, Katie Holmes looks like her eyes are going to slide off her face, but everything else in the movie was great. Who would have thought that Micheal Keaton would be supplanted as \"the\" Batman? Christian Bale was fantastic. He has the build, the brooding brow, the spark of mischief Batman seriously needed. Keaton had it all but the build. Casting is everything in a movie, and obviously they went all out on this one. From Gary Oldman(on the side of the light, this time)and Micheal Caine (who works in any movie and usually makes them better than they were before) to Liam Neeson and even a small part by Ken Watanebe who shined in \"The Last Samurai\", the cast truly made the movie. (Even Katie). And apparently Katie makes much better choices in work than her boyfriend. The plot was simple, yet elegant. We all know the story of Batman, where he came from, why he does what he does, and his backdrop, Gotham, and the crime within the city. We are given reasons for the crime, another good performance by Linus Roache (Riddick)as Bruce's father, and some great performances by the villains, especially Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow. The plot is simple but seamless. There are beginnings and endings which flow smoothly. The action is great, the cinematography is excellent, with Gothom stark and dark at the same time. Truly a great experience of a long movie which could have been longer."

As well as all the Two-Faces, Poison Ivys and a Mr Freeze to ice this all over. This is hot ! We explore here the true origins of the Bat Man, alias Bruce Wayne, whom, in fear of bats and to cure his thirst of justice after the murder of his parents, had to be picked up by a Ninja clan after serving some time in an Asian jail. However, those who train him had more than justice in their minds and Bruce must flee in order to serve justice in Gotham City, now rotten with corruption and crime all over. But he must do justice with the help of Wayne Enterprises, the company owned by his late father and that he inherited. He'll soon find out this company is as well mingled in organized crime, and it's with the help of one Luscious Fox, employee of this company, as well as the Wayne's butler Alfred, that he might find what he was looking for, and support from a childhood friend, Rachel, the D.A.'s assistant, who secretly roots for him, and Lieutenant Gordon, only ally of the Police Force who believes he is not another vigilante.Christian Bale is no doubt the best Bruce Wayne/Batman ever, as he transients his character all the way. The rest of the cast is fine, but Katie Holmes seemed young for the D.A.'s assistant role.At least, we understand now Mr.Wayne's fear, as he becomes as fearful as the bats who attacked him in the well in his childhood years, a powerful way to fight for justice in Gotham City..."

        "Context": "To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called \"Batman\" in 1989, selfishly I said, \"I want something new!\".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic."

        "Rating": 10,
        "Context": "It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10"

        "Context": "Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see Wayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his connection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see Bruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his car, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.That's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't writing his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is genuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects.. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love Michael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie Holmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance, but simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am always blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is frightening & menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats themselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.There is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most part this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans. This NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again. Bravo Mr Nolan, bravo."

        "Context": "I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind)."

        "Context": "........ ..............................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL Warner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!Director, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson & Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! In the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of \"Super-Star\". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so\u0085What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) On the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware\u0085audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .For my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .To highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .Before rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book \"super-hero\", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close\u0085Let's try to keep things in perspective, O.K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS! 10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!

        "Context": "I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, \"This is it! This is the movie!\" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question."

        "Context": "BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a \"darker\" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish. Warning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived."

Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.Much has been said of the film's \"reality\" quotient, and I'm here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman's strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it's believable.

All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of \"the young girl\" or \"girlfriend\". I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don't want to waste my time watching a conventional, corny, over-digitalized,plot less film. To be honest, I gave this film a chance not because it was a Batman movie, but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well as being a fan of Christopher Nolan's previous films. Whether you're a fan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic, you'll enjoy every single second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The violence in this movie is not vulgar, but rather sends out a lot of great messages of loyalty, respect, and humility. Not only is \"Batman Begins\" the best of the Batman series, it is the most unconventional. This recommendation is coming from a person who mostly watches art-house/independent films."

In fact, it turned out to be my favourite Batman movie even though I really like the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton. I really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic death of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in Asia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja than a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as Batman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But also I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why Katie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I liked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal; not to mention better-looking. It's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great as Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I mean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker and his death.

I never thought I would see a Batman movie with depth and that showed the true fear that is the character Batman that he brings to his enemies. Christian Bale did a excellent job and I truly look forward to him in another Batman Movie! The story was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion very original. Raj Al Ghul is an excellent villain and to portray him in the way he was portrayed was top notch, not to mention he was played very well. Many people I talked to complained that the actor who played him was not of Asian decent. However I believe it truly didn't matter at all.Not to mention Alfred was great. Gordon (later Commissioner Gordon) was excellent as well.No other Batman Movie has portrayed Batman truly as the Dark Knight and as I said already I truly look forward to more along these lines.-ND"

I braced myself to a very good movie at least and Nolan hasn't let me down .. it is the only Batman movie that you could call a masterpiece even people who liked it less consider it a very good movie and the best batman (so far). This movie is loaded with class A starts (like other batman movies) but they are the best of the best .. Liam Neeson & Michael Caine were very good .. Morgan Freeman wasn't at his best but he was OK at least .. Christian Bale is a unique actor and I think he will show us great performance in other movies to come in the future .. he is the type of actor he will try everything and anything that makes his performance good .. keep in mind his awesome performance in \"The Machinist\" .. he has a great facial expresses that he uses very good .. Gary Oldman wasn't very good but wasn't bad either .. Cillian Murphy also was very good .. even Katie Holmes was good. The visual effects were convening and were so realistic that sometimes I feel that they didn't use much of computer effects. What can I say about this masterpiece !! in short, Christopher Nolan worked hardly on this movie and he surely has lifted it up to the masterpiece level .. everything sounds prefect in this movie. Do not miss it .. it is one of the best in 2005 and absolutely the best batman movie (so far) .. I hope Nolan is directing the next batman so I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Batman Begins."

This is the best heroic movie ever produced, and it sets the stage to become the most phenomenal production the world will ever see.Additionally, Christian Bale is the best Bruce Wayne, and Batman I have ever seen on film. Although Michael Keaton was good, Bale exceeds his performance, and excels in this film with epic features and excellency in all aspects of heroism.I highly recommend this film to all, as it may be the best movie ever produced, in my opinion. Furthermore, Michael Caine is a wonderful supporting actor, and he makes \"Alfred\" impossibly believable during the film. He provides character to the Wayne family. Lastly, Katie Holmes makes a great appearance in this film, and has a strong character who tries to fight the impossible growing criminal society of Gotham City."

This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.."

        "Context": "With all obvious accounting, the Batman Magic' is back! Not since Michael Keaton, when the first modern and great, big screen Batman appeared in 1989, has there been such a commotion made about a new Batman movie. I had not seen this in the movie theater, but as with the first I started seeing bumper stickers and baseball caps and posters of the Batman Begins logos and the like, that's what let me know this was different, than the others. The first Keaton one, I saw it right-off-the-bat! No waiting, with this there had been so many in between, that seemed to be slipping more and more with every new installment, that I simply 'balked' at the thought of Batman 'Again'.Well after I had caught my breath I was astounded at the beauty of the first scenes and how this film instantly whisked me into the whole story. Amazed, as I watched 'Bale' brought on the 'Knight' with a new era of and a fresh-feeling crisp new character/hero. Liam Neeson, enters from out of nowhere and he is a thing of beauty. A solid-cast mentor/trainer in the fine art of crime fighting. Neeson is a pillar in the 'Begin' set. As the grueling training comes to a successful end, there comes the time to re-enter his broken life, complete with his estate and butler. Michael Caine is delightful as the classy care servant 'Alfred'. There was some real genius, to place Caine in this position, he fits to a 'T'. Rutger Hauer, is an acting hero of mine from way back and this was just an unexpected treat of a performance that he had in the story. Gary Oldman, is versatile, Tom Cruise wishes he was as good as Old' Gary. Oldman is inspirational with every labored breath that he took. I was amused too, at one point as the Batman made a surprise appearance at Gordon's (Oldman) home, on the steps Batman informs him of the situation and as he answers Oldman is doing a perfect 'Christopher Walken' styled delivery, just in those few sentences. That gave even a wider performance overall. In the hotel, I laughed as Bruce Wayne having friendly dinner conversation with colleagues from his company when asked about the news of the Batman, says \"A man dressed as a bat clearly has some issues to take care of.\" Schluffing it off, as just another crazy man in the dark city. Pure gold.I must say, that Katie Holmes seemed a little too young for me in the beginning, albeit she came through toward the end with a satisfying role. Tom Wilkinson, playing the big crime boss, was reminiscent of the days of Nicholson (the Joker) with the late great Jack Palance,(Boss Grissom) but surely didn't reach the criminal element that these two gave off in stellar performance's in Burton's 89' Batman. At one point in the prison holding room, Wilkinson seemed to be acting much like Dan Hedaya, as he was speaking to counsel as the crime lord.Morgan Freeman is wondrously refreshing, and apart from other roles he has played, I enjoyed Lucius Fox for everything that he (Freeman) gave it, simple, easy and likable. The other players all found excellent fitting surrounding our main names. There was a lot put into this one no denying it, I was overtaken by the classic yet new styling of the camera shots and the places that the story took us to, and last but not least that Bat-Vehicle is something that every Hummer 'wishes' it could dream, wake-up and become. The Bat-S.U.V. for all your needs.Thoroughly penetrating in delivery, this has a strength and smoothness in it's style, it is a solid tailor-crafted action/drama ...a sure fire hit. (*****)"

What makes this movie so great is how it takes its material so seriously. There is also a main theme that ties the movie together: Fear. It's relentless in its quest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public persona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of the movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a movie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier for the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic experience, and it shouldn't be missed. One of the year's best films, and quite possibly the best comic book-hero-movie of all time. If you have seen this movie once, then it gets even better by the second time you see it. And if you haven't seen it yet... well, what the hell took you so long?!"

        "Context": "Saw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low for this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over the top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think that spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted \"Batman Begins\" has a pretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book, but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and Cillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!).I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10, as I am pretty brutal with ratings, but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally, this is what Batman should have been all along - The Dark Knight! Anyone who is a Batman, Nolan, Bale, Murphy fan will not be disappointed. I only wish I took that money I spent on \"Star Wars: ... Sith\" went to \"Batman\"."

Not only is Batman Begins decent, it has got to be one of THE BEST FILM EVER! i watched the film on its last screening together with my friends in Alabang. after the movie, the entire theater was deserted and i just sat there, still trying to catch my breath. It is that damn good.Christian Bale plays the perfect Batman/Bruce Wayne. Charming, handsome, and \"rich,\" as Wayne. Terrifying, maniacal, sadistic, and blacker than black as Batman. \"It's not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me.\" Michael Caine as Alfred, humorous, he is the rock of the Batman family. Almost always, the exchange between Bale and Caine where Christian tells him \"You still haven't given up on me, have you?\" Caine answers \"Nevah.\" Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Quite different from the character in the real Batman mythology (which for me is the comic books), but important nonetheless. He's told in the film as the one who supplies Bruce with all of his \"spilunking\" stuff. :) Morgan plays it brilliantly, from his face in the Tumbler while Bruce is driving, to his deadpan humor near the ending of the film. \"Didn't you get the memo?\" That got one of the biggest laughs in the theater.Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson. Awesome! As Henri Ducard and the real Ra's Al Ghul, he was cold, beyond reason. Cold, bad-ass in a great way. Esp. the scenes where he and Bruce were in their ninja suits playing a game of \"hide-and-seek\" with all those ninjas. Some of the best lines came from Neeson's Ducard character. \"Are you ready to begin? Katie Holmes. She's actually the \"weakest\" link as far as all reviewers or critics are concerned, but for a fan, well, she actually is. Not weak, but pretty much, the film could have gone without her. Having her die at the end of the movie would have made an even better way to start the Begins sequel given Batman's occasional experiences with deaths that he feels responsible for. (i.e. the drowned girl in the VENOM series, Jason Todd) But she does put some nice boy meets girl syndrome during the early years of Bruce. (Oh, speaking of history, Bruce Wayne did NOT finish college nor did he finish in Princeton) And, imho, the end scenes where she and Bruce kissed was ABSOLUTELY YUCKY! i dunno, but for me, it was totally unnecessary but seeing as how the protagonist and the girl should kiss even once in a movie scheme held up, well, there ya go. \"You better run!\" Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow actually should have gotten more screen time. He was really scary even in his \"doctor\" mode. the first time we get to see the mask during his talk with Falcone, awesome. We really got to see the extent of how this lean, geeky fellow could actually become one of Batman's worst enemies. Ken Watanabe, very limited screen time. Doggone good nonetheless.and who could forget...Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. \"I have to get me one of those.\" Damn right. \"I think you're trying to help.\" Can't wait for the next Batman sequel just for the fact that i'd love to see more of Jim Gordon's interaction with the Batman.Overall, this movie gets a perfect 10 out of 5 stars :) This movie has it all. Great plot, dialogue, action, and an array of Oscar caliber actors, definitely, Batman renaissance has begun. Batman Begins."

        "Context": "Over the years the Gotham City that was once a dark place lined with evil and corruption, in desperate need of a hero, deteriorated into a circus tent of Hollywood displays with over-dramatic architecture and special effects... Where criminals dance around in blacklight sensitive face paint and so-called villains compete for best comedic performance. Behind all the bright lights and all-star celebrity casting, we lost grasp of what the saga is really about: Batman.Batman Begins opens with Bruce Wayne's discovery as a little boy of an underground cave where he is traumatized by an attack of massive waves of thousands of hideous bats. From this incident came an instilled fear that will forever torment Bruce Wayne. After the death of his parents, a deep hatred towards crime grows more and more until Bruce decides to vanish from Gotham City. He learns the skills of an ancient vigilante ninja organization, developing not only the skills of martial arts but most importantly the mastery of fear- skills that will ultimately be the best weapons in facing the evils that will reach Gotham City and to avenge the death of his beloved parents.Batman Begins restores the integrity of the Batman saga and goes into an even deeper conflict... his constant struggle with fear and his deep hatred towards everything evil. What the other Batman movies lightly touched on, Batman Begins tells vividly. Why a billionaire would devote his life to fighting evil. Where he gets all his nifty convenient gadgets. Why Bruce Wayne can take on 30 armed guys all on his own and without a gun. And finally why he dresses up as a bat... after all \"A guy who dresses up as a bat... clearly has issues.\" And Batman does and should have issues, especially after witnessing first hand the death of his loving parents, deaths that he feels partly responsible for. The other movies didn't emphasize enough the true anger Bruce Wayne has towards those that commit to a life of evil, but in this movie, Batman, effectively played by Christian Bale, is clearly depicted as a man anxious to release his anger and frustration to avenge the death of his parents.Evil is definitely present in this movie. Where the villains in previous Batman movies seem like decent people to hang out with, or in Poison Ivy's case make out with, the enemies in this movie know there is a job to be done and that there is no time to be funny- not to belittle Jack Nicholson's role of the Joker, who has a right to be funny. The depiction of the Scarecrow was amazing, possessing an evil presence unlike any other Batman villain.As much as I loved Tim Burton's work, and Michael Keaton's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, I'd have to say that the direction of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale as Batman put together the best Batman movie ever made. Besides Christian Bale, the casting was impressive. Alfred, played by Michael Caine and Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, are both characters you'll be glad to have alongside Bruce Wayne.It really is refreshing to see Batman and to finally learn after decades who he really is. A Batman who is angry and troubled and there to kick some ass not just for show but with a passion. Now the legend can live on with dignity and generations from now on can see the true man behind the bat... not just some heartthrob in tight pants."

        "Context": "quote. When I heard they were making another Batman movie that explored the origins of Batman with promises of a much better conceived portrayal of the dark knight, I was very excited. Then, when I heard that Christian Bale who's famous for his dark and sinister characters in \"American Psycho\" and \"The Machinist\", was going to play Batman, I got even more excited. Then, the announcement that Christopher Nolan of \"Memento\" fame was picked to direct it, and I was almost certain this film was to not only be the best Batman movie in the franchise, but the best film of the year! Then I saw it.Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. The movies seemed to fall flat in a number of places. For starters, let's begin with direction. With Christopher Nolan in the drivers seat, I kind of expected a tight, clever plot with a less formulaic film style then what was presented. Sure, I mean Nolan had to stick with the script that was given to him and not tamper with the story of Batman. But I felt that the story could have been better displayed. The action scenes in the movie were too quick and flashy, leaving the characters on the screen virtually indistinguishable from one another. What I took away from the film was that it was loud and there were a lot of flashy action sequences where apparently something happened. The film seems to move too quick in some areas and too slow in others. I mean, was the entire process of becoming Batman completely necessary. At least the previous films left some sense of mystery of who Bruce Wayne was and where he got his bat gadgets. I mean, who really cares when it comes down to it? It took away from the plot of Batman Begins.Let's talk about the acting - subpar at best. Hollywood actors should have to have licences to act then Katie Holmes should have hers revoked for her role as a Assistant DA. She was about as convincing as an attorney as Denise Richards was as a nuclear scientist in that stupid James Bond movie. She was supposed to play Bruce Wayne's (Bale) love interest but the on screen chemistry between the two is laughable. Bale's acting was OK, but not like anything we've seen him do in the past. I think if he portrayed Bruce Wayne more like his psychologically tormented character Trevor Reznik in \"The Machinist\", we would have had a better movie on our hands.All in all, this movie wasn't anything special. It was your typical Hollywood formula, good guy versus bad guy, special effects extravaganza with no real value at all.A very forgettable film with bad acting, unnecessary scenes, poor direction and a penchant for overkilling the point. Yes, we understand Bruce Wayne doesn't like bats, and he has to overcome his fear and bring justice to the city of Gotham and yadayada.....blahhhhhhhhh! This oversimplified account of the story of Batman should have been given a different title - \"Batman for dummies and for people that like things that go vrooom and boooooom!\" In its defense, however, it was better than that god awful \"Batman and Robin\". If you really want to watch a good Batman movie, watch the first one. end of quote. the best it can get is 5. I voted 1 just to try to make the result balanced a bit."

In some ways that works but in other ways it veers off into a Batman universe that makes no sense and becomes basically a movie that seems like he's attempting to have Batman seem more realistic to being like a person in our real universe. This is where Nolan fails. The magic and fun of Batman evaporates quickly. A man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime has a humorous element to it that Nolan completely ignores with this incarnation and everyone in this universe acts really dumb about it and their reactions to it make little sense especially Gordon's character. A lot of what Gordon does lacks logical sense and he never seems to really question the mental state of the person he first sees dressed as a bat. He's portrayed like some idiot willing to eventually put complete trust in someone he knows practically nothing about running around in a bat suit. His reasons for being so trusting are never clear. Does he know something everyone else doesn't? Bale's performance was pretty average but not as compelling as Keaton or Kilmer. He also tries to have a Batman voice that sounds ridiculous. The only reason for this film's critical success is that it struck a cord with the comic book fan die hards. It certainly didn't do that impressive box office numbers. Now with news that Nolan is going to present The Joker in a sequel, I see a potential disaster waiting to happen."

The absurdity of Batman Begins was how serious it was trying to be which made you laugh at it rather than with it. The Scarecrow was the most disappointing villain of any of the previous Batman films. He was completely boring and just downright stupid. This film was such a complete insult to the fans who have stuck with the movie series through the good sequels and the bad.

A man dressed up as a bat is something that could never be taken completely seriously without a touch of camp. That's why Burton nailed the task of dark with just the right amount of campiness. As for this film, it's neither a sequel or a prequel. Good actors with the exemption of casting mistake, Katie Holmes, good director but other than utterly unnecessary retread of the origin story. Batman has already been reinvented twice and now a third. I will give props to Christian Bale but still not up to par with the likes of Michael Keaton. And Jack Nicholson's performance that was fascinating and brilliant at the same time? That's an impossible act to follow. The villain in this film was neither scary or interesting. Boring and instantly forgettable is more like it. It's no wonder moviegoers are left in such a catatonic state from Hollywood's desperate attempts at creativity. How many times can you reinvent the same franchise? A far more interesting installment should've been BATMAN ENDS."

He makes realistic films and Batman Begins should have been made more fantasy.Tim Burton where are you?"

This film is an obvious feeble stab at resurrecting a moribund Batman series that should have gone to a peaceful demise 8 years ago. Katie Holmes? Please. Probably a nice kid, but she'd barely survive a casting call for summer theater in Akron, Ohio. The pretentious, plodding script is lugubrious, morose and utterly incredible--even for a comic book. What is this nonsense about Shangri-La and Ninja gibberish and psychobabble about fear and revenge? Don't even ask about the ludicrously lame scenes of battle and urban catastrophe--pathetic. The editors should be taken out and shot. But wait! No! They had nothing to work with! If you need one simple proof of how rotten this is, just consider the great character actor Gary Oldman embarrassingly mired in this bat dung. I did however love Rutger Hauer as Donald Rumsfeld. Michael Caine should have paid to have his scenes deleted. Morgan Freeman, the default Black eminence in many recent films, phones in his routine performance. Liam Neeson, a superb actor, is again relegated to a murky back-story clich\u00e9d role as in Gangs of New York and a couple of later Star Wars pics. One standout in this mess is Cillian Murphy as a preening, smarmy uber-yuppie.

However I feel \"Batman Begins\" is the worst interpretation of Batman ever. I admit I was not too happy with the reinterpretation that occurred with \"Batman Forever\" but that I could live with because there was still a lot of amusing and visual elements to it that made it watchable. \"Batman Begins\" on the other hand is heavy handed and a little too much so to the point that it becomes abysmal and practically unwatchable early on in the first act. I found it becoming tedious with Bale delivering lines like an automaton and even though I think he's a good actor and liked him in other roles, he just wasn't Batman and did not fit the role well enough. As for seasoned actors Freeman, Oldman, and Caine popping in this mish mesh I have no idea what on earth they were thinking. They just made it more grating to bear. Caine has a lot of cred and has been in many superior films but it was actually depressing watching him tread through this sloppy disjointed sludge. He needs to retire. And the less mentioned about the dreadful and miscast Katie Holmes aka Mrs. Cruise the better. I think this was very much catered to the current MTV generation with extremely short attention spans and little imagination. This movie did not amuse or fancy me the way previous Batman films did. In fact it did not entertain me in that way at all, and for that reason I found it to be without value whatsoever. I say why even bother making a Batman film that is so abysmally dull and dim."

The visuals were striking but no more striking than Burton's. The actors' performance were OK but Christian Bale as Superman was much the weenie at times and downright boring. Very very little is left the same from all previous representations that all is left is use of character names and places. Is that particularly innovative and creative? Uhhh no I don't think so.

Moving on to the 2hr+ piece of crap known as batman begins, i don't even know where to start ripping this flick -i will list only a few reasons why this movie should never have been made or thrown in the trash instead of releasing upon the public.1. Christian Bale's voice as Batman(tries to deepen his voice) it gets not only annoying but it sounds incredibly forced and dreadful.2. The scarecrow villain is in the movie for literally 1 minute of film time, completely a waste of time because underdeveloped is an understatement.3. The joker is supposed to kill Bruce Wayne's parents when Bruce is younger, not some random poor lowly criminal. Then what should happen is seeking revenge, Bruce turns the murderer of his parents into the Joker. -completely dropped the ball on this one4. Being Batman Begins, Batman can not have a better more updated car than Batman, made in 1989. If its a prequel, make sure everything coincides with the other films - not that hard.5. At the end of the movie - A) Batman gives the bat symbol to gordon - he is not commissioner yet and does not fit with other films b) Jim Gordon shows Batman a joker card, indicating a criminal is out and about on the streets of Gotham- If Bruce Wayne is supposed to in essence create the Joker, how is he around? Doesn't add up at all, leaves more frustration and questions.more things i would have mentioned about this horrendous film - Jim Gordon's character, Bruce Wayne's personality, the batcave, Katie Holmes' character, and a few other small things.All and all just a pile of garbage. The best superhero series as of our time right now is far and away Spiderman. The story is engrossing and extremely well written, and has tremendous casting, unlike Batman Begins."

Christian Bale's performance as Batman is the best acting I've seen since Reginald VelJohnson played Carl Winslow on \"Family Matters\". I dare you not to laugh when Batman is angry, he sounds like Dirty Harry with a speech impediment. Not to mention the profound dialog, I didn't hear a single word uttered from any actors mouth throughout the seven hours that this movie lasted that didn't sound blatantly scripted. I think every other sentence had something to do with fear or revenge or justice. Spare me, for the love of God. Who wrote this anyway, Socrates? What is Batman's real name again, Ralph Waldo Emerson? This film is just one lengthy diatribe of philosophical drivel. If you really must see this movie, despite everything I am telling you, might I recommend reading the novel first, Plato's Republic. I don't know why Chris Nolan ever thought he could do a superhero movie in the first place; I suppose it had something to do with the success of his previous action/adventures, \"Memento\" and \"Insomnia\" (if you suffer from insomnia, I recommend watching this work-of-art to help you sleep). This movie suffered from the same things all of Nolan's films suffer from, poor editing, weak character development (if any in some cases), lack of suspense, etc. If you love action movies that don't have action, movies with clich\u00e9 dialog, horrid acting, and god-awful cinematography that prevents you from understanding what the hell is going on, then this movie is a must-see!

Having said that, I felt that Goyer's Batman Begins script comes off like a sloppy forgery of Miller's Batman: Year One miniseries (down to lifting the last scene with the Joker's playing card), with villains inappropriately thrown-in. The Bat-Tank is an idea from Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns and it is also tossed in, not to assist the story, but to pander to a motor-crazy American culture in a moment of pimp-my-Batmoblie obviously inserted in the script by a Warner Bros. marketing team after reviewing last year's Hummer sales.I don't mean to totally hate-on a film without cause, after all this IS a step above the Joel Schumacher versions of the Dark Knight, but only slightly. This film has none of the visual resonance or thrilling pleasure of Tim Burton's Batman movies, also Katie Holmes' character is used to twice rip-off the Burton movies. Most offensive was at the end when a familiar line is used, badly, to reveal that Bruce is the Bat to the female lead, which is exactly like the mistletoe line in Batman Returns only much more lame. So lets say I was still expecting better, and I also felt that many of the 'jokes' that were designed to relieve the tension fell flat, like Gordon seeing the Bat-Tank and saying 'I gotta get me one of those.' I did like Garry Oldman's version of Lt. Gordon, but he wasn't used in any interesting such as the personal crisis Gordon faces in Miller's Year One. For me, Nolan's style for capturing the fight sequences was a total misfire, as you could rarely see a single landed impact through the over-editing. ASIDE FROM NOT BEING THE DEFINITIVE BATMAN MOVIE, IT IS JUST NOT A GOOD MOVIE PERIOD. I wasn't expecting perfection, just an enjoyable evening in Gotham City and they didn't even give me that. I had read some reviews asserting that Frank Miller fans and the Sin City crowd will be satisfied with this one, which can't be the case. If Warner Bros. wanted to make the Frank Miller people happy than they would have done a film of the real Batman: Year One with Darren Aronofsky directing, as originally planned 3\u00bd years ago. Also, everyone was saying how serious and realistic this film was, and yet the climax of the film was so overwrought with separate elements that it became laughable. Goyer's attempts to clumsily tie the too-many strands of this film together with a death-train headed straight for the Wayne Enterprises building which will poison and evaporate all the water in Gotham within an instant. Come on, we can do better than this. This is a horrible idea for the ending of any movie, and to me is comparable in many ways to the very silly ending of Batman Forever.I found Nolan and Goyer did not learn from the mistakes of Schumacher, electing not to emphasise a single villain and instead orchestrating a rather lame pageant of familiar characters without focusing on any of them. In Batman Begins, the genocidal cult-leader Ra's Al Ghul isn't the charismatic megalomaniac as he is in the comics and cartoons and the Scarecrow is limited to an Arkham administrator / mob chemist. I am a dedicated DC comics guy, however if this is any indication of the type of DC films that are on their way into theatres, then Marvel has already won the biggest battle of them all. Both the Spider-Man and X-men films were far superior to Batman Begins, and in particular Spider-Man 2 had compelling action with a story that featured the allegorical properties of the superhero. I am sorry to report that Batman Begins offers us nothing more than action sequences which are obscured by 'stylish' editing in an endlessly hollow feature."

I know there's much more than looking the part (George Clooney comes to mind), but it's a factor. He seemed too emotionless, detached. Christian is a good actor and I saw it...but it seems he fell short. Michael Keaton still holds the reigned for the most intense and perfect Bruce Wayne AND Batman.BONUS: The ending seemed a bit pushy (even if I did orgasm at it). But it was confusing for my friend. He was questioning if it was to show that it was a prequel to the Batman '89 movie. I explained that they were starting over. But still, I can see how people could be confused. Personally I'd leave the first two Batman movies in the timeline and redo Forever and Batman and Robin.Even looking back, I don't' know what to say. One thing, it's an awesome and excellent movie. Another, it's mediocre at best.I'll give it 6 out of 10. You might love it...you might not."

But unfortunately....Take a seemingless endless budget, and all\u0096star cast, great special effects, set design, costume design, and add in a monkey for a script writer / director. What do you get? A movie a bunch of hopefull Batman fans go to, and end up grimacing at every line of dialog. You get a movie that is trying hard to be a psychological thriller, but seems to have been written by a 8 year old. The movie lacks any consistency, and any real understanding of what it is trying to do. By then end of the movie, you are stuck wondering , what the bleep was the point of any of this!?!??! You get a beautiful to watch, yet, literally painful to follow mess.What happened? In earlier Batman movies Burton went for a more campy vision of Batman. Well the fans wanted something darker, something along the lines for the more realistic \"Batman: Year One\". So Hollywood decides to cash in on another attempt at Batman, in the height of the whole Comic book movie craze. And someone decided this meant diving into Bruce Wayne's psyche, and showing his \"transition\" to Batman. In Burton's Batman, they just showed enough of a story we all know and let us settle the rest in our imagination. In Nolan's version everything is so blatant yet not thought out enough to stop it from completely contradicting itself. We are beat over the head again and again with Wayne's inner conflicts. There are several excellent ideas throughout the fill that just keep falling flat on their face, either because of not getting fleshed out properly, or just simply from contradicting themselves. Little about the movie makes any sense, from the characters philosophies, to training with live metal swords and no head gear. Burton's movies were at least consistent. They worked within themselves, creating a world that gelled together. He stayed true to his vision of Batman, and came up with some solid, consistent movies. With Batman begins, expect to go from a great scene, to sitting there and just thinking, what the bleep did I just see. The scenes with a child Bruce Wayne are just painfully bad. Expect no consistency, no vision, no cohesive story.So what is this film worth? It is a typical shallow action based comic book hero movie with little true substance behind it. Expect ridiculous leaps of faith as far as what is physically \"possible\", expect stupid car chases where the \"hero\" almost gets dozens of people killed and tears of the city, expect anything but a good story.Production value 9/10. Story and script 2/10. Overall 4/10."

The tank-looking bat-mobile... need I say more? Secondly, Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow's origin was never discussed, thus leaving people that don't know about the legend clueless.Also, the continual mentioning of the city's water supply and the neurotoxic gas was slightly annoying.Finally, the one element that they forgot was the one thing that Tim Burton nailed dead-on: humor! There was no shred of humor to keep this thing together. Even Forrest Gump was a drama, but it managed to be funny too; this on the other hand, took itself way too seriously.To finalize, for Batman fans everywhere, this isn't really one that I'd recommend."

        "Context": "I must be one of the only people in the U.S. that hates this movie. Not just dislikes, but HATES. That's right; I despise this flick. Let me explain why...When I was in high school, Tim Burton's Batman came out in theaters. I remember it being one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences of my life. Goofy bat-props aside, it was epic, colorful, and operatic. It was what any true comic book movie should aspire to. I still consider Burton's movie the best superhero movie ever made. Yep, you heard me right.I will be the first to admit that went into Christopher Nolan's version with a biased opinion. How could Nolan, a director known for Hitchcock-like suspense movies, ever beat Burton's dark vision? After viewing Batman Begins, it turns out I was right to question everything I had heard about it. This movie sucks.Nolan is best left to directing off-kilter thrillers. Given his unique directing style, I have to admit that I was excited to find out that he was going to be helming this one. Unfortunately, he shows none of the originality that seeps through in his other flicks like Memento and The Prestige. How can such a good director turn out uninspired, boring schlock like this? Batman Begins is so ham-fisted and pretentious that I felt like I had been forced into watching a Baptist tent revival for two hours. The characters love sermonizing about \"good vs. evil\" and \"morality vs. immorality\". Especially Katie Holmes and Michael Caine. Now, I am a big fan of Caine's work (I won't even comment on Holmes; how she got cast in this movie is beyond me), but turning Alfred into a nagging I-Told-You-So moralist is completely aggravating. David S. Goyer should be smacked for writing such pandering drivel.I am a huge fan of Christian Bale. I have a ton of his movies in my collection. I had big hopes for his turn as the Caped Crusader. He is the only actor in this movie that even pretends to care about what is going on, despite his very wooden performance. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite thespians of all time, but he was a braindead zombie throughout the whole flick. Ditto for Holmes, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, and Ken Watanabe. How could so many great actors sleepwalk through one production? It's all mindboggling.The whole thing feels like a project that had a ton of energy at the beginning, but everyone involved slowly lost interest and just decided to finish it so they could collect their paychecks. Very Sad. This had such huge potential, and it turned out to be just another Hollywood cash cow.There were some highlights for me, though. The final train showdown was really cool, as was the appearance a psychopathic Scarecrow on the streets of Gotham looking like one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Ultimately, Batman Begins is marred by poor scriptwork, poor direction, and even poorer acting. I am consistently amazed by reviews that herald it as \"the movie of the year\" or \"the best superhero movie ever made\". Uggh.I'll stick to Zebraman, thank you very much. At least that has some creativity to it."

The set up is long and often tedious and the dialogue is surprisingly \"New Star Wars\" bad. Even the bast costume itself looks off. They were promising us more flexibility and believability with this design but it still looked awkward. Keaton's original still looks better.

Too choppy and too damn close. You need a second set of eyes to see what the hell is actually happening during the action. The music, or rather lack thereof, was horrendous. Warner Bros. hired Zimmer and Howard to compose an orchestral masterpiece, and all that was made by these two men was a two-note fanfare!? How disappointing! The bat mobile chase, the training montage, and the \"climactic\" train sequence were so clich\u00e9. Didn't we already see this in a certain web-slinger's movie. I read that Nolan used about half of the budget on the car and train chases. Where did it all go?! The tumbler chase is just loud and uneventful. The \"monorail\" has three layers of train tracks, and only ONE car on ONE track was used. What potential the climax had! What a let down! The villains were stupid, but well acted. Cillian was neat, but his Scarecrow needed more than 1 minute of screen time to make an impact on the psyche. For sure there will be a sequel, but \"Begins\" has nothing on \"Memento,\" \"Insomnia,\" and \"Following.\" Does \"sucks\" have three or four U's? Happy Viewing, If you can."

Plus the story was pretty awful the 'villan' was dumb and it just didn't have anything like the other films. I like the whole fantasy edge to Batman and the way the villains are formed (Joker with the acid, Catwoman with the cats etc) the film has none of this.

It really was not well-spoken.The plot, while unlikely, is totally non-cohesive and one finds themselves constantly laughing throughout and the nonsense they are watching. The characters are weakly written (especially Gary Oldman's pathetically boring 'Good-guy' cop) and the screenplay could have been conceived of by a 12 year-old C grade student. I only watched this because it was on sale after Thanksgiving for $4.88 on DVD and I can honestly say it wasn't even worth that.If you are really in the mood for a good comic book movie, watch the first X-Men movie.

And I love Cillian Murphy to death, but Doctor Crane is a gangly, red headed maniac. Not a drop dead gorgeous man. Comish G, perfect performance by Gary Oldman.I like how they used not so popular villains in this movie, but thats about it. Storyline is utterly insane. The police force/authorities of Gotham in a \"league of shadows\"(another non-popularvillain group of 'Vertigo'...bad mix of villains in my view.) to \"fix\" Gotham? No way. Never.If they rushed this movie to get it out to the \"Crying\" public, they should have waited and saved up money to get people that actually FIT the freaking character.

I mean, come on! The goatee/mustache IS Ra's Al Gul! DID NO ONE ELSE SEE THAT?!?!

Ah well, I've lost all my faith in comic-book to film adaptations. At least Sin City pushed the limits (of good and bad taste).

Michael Caine and Liam Neeson, fine actors who often seem to take roles to pay off their credit card debts, turn in the worst performances of their respective careers. Christian Bale turns in a stunning, or rather stunned performance (he seemed to be under the influence of some kind of heavy sedative). Only Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes gave performances worth mentioning. The first because although he's in another of those \"wise prophet in bad movie roles\" that he seems to specialize in these days, his performance is warm and energetic. His Fox is actually likable -- in a three-dimensional way. Holmes turns in her best performance since Dawson's Creek. It's not saying much, but it's something.The plot and the characters is beyond unbelievable and, in some ways, downright offensive. Bruce Wayne's father, a billionaire industrialist who also happens to be a physician, who builds a monorail -- a MONORAIL! -- to pull the city out of a depression (but not the national economy? Does the monorail go all the way to Metropolis, too?), and centralizes all transportation and the municipal water supply in his own corporate headquarters is a good guy? Huh? Sounds like a megalomaniacal John D. Rockefeller-meets-Boss-Tweed type, actually.This isn't a minor point, since the father is central to Bruce Wayne's motivation (and his hackneyed Oedipal -- we saw it in Star Wars -- relationship with Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul). What the film is saying is that, without the intervention of corporate capital (Wayne Enterprises), the body politics will collapse in on itself; that the corporation -- Halliburton, maybe? -- will save the nation where civil society has failed. Make no mistake, Bruce Wayne is NOT a lone vigilante; he is the enforcement arm of the trillion dollar corporation he runs and which arms him. Given the state of things today, I find that disturbing.The plot is so full of inconsistencies, that I wouldn't know where to start. The one that leaped out at me and had me shaking my head the most, though, was the idea that the best way to stop the microwave weapon from blowing up the central water system was to send it sailing into the central water system. I'm no physicist, but wouldn't the pressure built up from the vaporized water leading INTO the central system cause it to blow? Wouldn't it be possible to blow the whole thing up just by getting close? There's not much to be said for this film. The long shots of Gotham City looked like the backdrops of a mid-90s video game. The on-site sets looked like they were trying to do Tim Burton without actually having the faintest idea how. I know Gotham is a declining megalopolis, but why does the WHOLE city look like a slum -- except for Wayne Manor, which seems to be in the foothills of the Scottish Highlands with nary a road nor a telephone pole, nor a building to be seen up to the horizon.I understand that superhero films require a suspension of disbelief. That, in fact, is part of their appeal. This one asks the viewer to suspend far too much. At the same time, it asks you to swallow an ideological message that only George W. Bush could love. That's just way too much."

Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience.

I do feel the Katie Holmes replacement was simply put- not ideal on any level. As phenomenal as Heath Ledger playing a sociopath....I think of \"One Flew Over the Kookoos Nest\", \"No Country for Old Men\", \"The Treasure of Sierra Madre\"....and our distorted notion that a celebrity overdose is tragic as opposed to a junkies does sicken me. To award him an Oscar he would not have been considered for if he was alive. Was simply damaging the social culture of this country. That being said an academy award has nothing to do with the grittiness and the dilemma that Bale as Batman struggles to deal with in a villain whose sole purpose was to expose that all people regardless of status are selfish narcissistic beings obsessed only with their own survival...though proved wrong in the movie, the year of 2020 from the individual level all the way up the political ladder of both Parties, as well as up the ladder in business there is a reality to the antagonists point of view."

We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."

        "Context": "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."

He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life.

I've tried to keep this spoiler-free, despite the fact that whatever unpredictability the moth-eaten plot has is based on the surprise being completely inexplicable in context. So forgive me if it's a bit vague in places.The latest Batman film, lauded by fan and critic alike, was apparently replaced at my theater with another similarly-titled film in which Iron Man fought the killer from Saw, who is intent on reproducing the last ten minutes of Spiderman II over and over again. Everyone in the film is either an idiot or an omniscient genius, but either way, they are the most unobservant bunch of people ever put on film. The whole movie would have sputtered to an instant conclusion if the city cell phone network had gone down. And even The Simpsons has lampooned 'The Only Bridge Out of Town'. And the first moment Batman is on screen, he is bending the barrel of a gun unto a U-shape. I think somebody was looking on the wrong page of their comics reference guide when they wrote all of the super strength + flying scenes in for Batman.This is an Idiot Picture. There was no set piece in this film that would not have been avoided by a modicum of common sense. Honestly, kudos to Heath Ledger--whoever he was playing that was impersonating The Joker as someone with no apparent sense of humor--but any normal person would have shot the man on sight just to stop him babbling for the next twenty minutes. Every freaking scene was a monologue! Of the same thing! Everyone did that, actually. The characters seldom had conversations, just extended monologues which aspired to be weighty and philosophical. And not a word they said mattered, because in the end, it comes down to punching someone, anyway. The Joker has only one trick, and it is the same one three or four times. Bale's characterization of Batman and Bruce Wayne is so lifeless, he doesn't even seem to have been in the film.Technically, it suffered from being heavily edited, apparently to obtain a PG-13 rating. Killings appear off-screen or in obvious jump cuts. Events are alluded to which not only do not occur, but appear to occur differently. Was this the airline version? How long would this thing have been as shot? It already exceeded two and a half hours. Happily, there was plenty of opportunity for bathroom breaks. Every time someone opened their mouth you had ten minutes free. Still, sloppy editing cannot excuse the way characters simply appear and disappear as needed by the script, regardless of the impossibility of getting there unnoticed. IITS* is essentially a plot device.If this seems like a litany of nitpicks without mention of all the good points, well, as far as I can tell, I mentioned ALL the good points.This film viciously wasted my time as if I was a character in it, trapped in a theater with fifty hitherto-unnoticed oil drums and the option to explode the audience of Wall-E.

Film is over-long, doesn't sufficiently build characters to the point where we care what happens to them, relies heavily on shocks, crashes, bangs and gadgets, and is probably best suited to teenage boys who are already Batman fans.

My movie's based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city. In it, there's going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died. And then there's going to be this other guy who, for no given reason, dresses up like a clown, acts creepy, and goes around killing people. The bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands. Meanwhile, there's this other guy who's a perfectly nice lawyer, but then his face gets burned, so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has.\" It sounds kind of funny and interesting to you, but just as you're accepting it, the person suddenly coughs under his breath, \"Oh yeah. And I'm going to take it seriously like it was Shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience.\" I'm not sure if that's exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went, but it seems to be a reasonable guess. Let's face it. The whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous. It could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved. And yet, it's still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life, and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across. How does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective? What does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil? Why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie? Give me the days of Adam West. At least his show made me happy rather than depressed."

Yes Heath was amazing, but it gets me thinking was this due to the script? Or heath's ability to understand and become a phycopath?

The answer to all these is of course..........no, and i don't understand why everyone is treating it like a god \"omg it was so amazing, best movie of the year\", you see people this type of person is called a \"Hype Hound\"(by the way, thats copy written =]), a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film, and the first few reviews.

        "Context": "It's hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together. Well let's start by saying that the Dark Knight is very boring and messy.The plot is incoherent, with too many undeveloped subplots. The movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere. It tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured, out of place, and doesn't build up from anything. Lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere. The characters have nothing, nothing interesting about them. They're like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor, taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are. And creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero, is what this movie is all about. All the rest comes as a consequence of this. Anything that happens has little or no effect. Batman is just as hollow as every one else. You could swap him with some other character and nothing would change. Action is just average. Random things happening out of nowhere, and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that. Some great effects here and there don't add much to the movie. I like violent movies but the violence in the DK is pretty much senseless as well as censored. Definitely not for young kids.The movie is not dark, is hollow. If you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome 'The Crow'. You want to see a good batman movie then watch the Tim Burton's version. Flat with no substance, humor or soul, the Dark Knight doesn't leave you with any emotions whatsoever, no hope and not even hopelessness. Only a lame sense of depression."

        "Context": "A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like \"masterpiece\" and \"crime-epic\". Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I don't blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys' hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious.I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want \"more realism\" as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents' murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isn't a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks don't pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what.I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works.EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros. & the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things."

The lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs, is bewildering. Staggering low-quality. I honestly found it unwatchable because of that, and what's even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill-produced production is considered a master piece by so many.

Usually, in this kind of situation where it's a comic book movie, you tend to let some things slide, however, when Nolan publicized his trilogy as being realistic (where he failed miserably), you end up cringing most of the time.The problem with TDK is there are too many inconsistencies smothered in incoherence... The fact that people (and critics) are usually very critical on everything, but did not notice all these plot holes in the movie and dubbed it \"the best comic book movie ever and one of the best movies ever made\". TDK, if you actually watch the movie, is not even top 10 material in its own genre, let alone being top 5 all time.The legion of Batmanites made this rating high, but it does not reflect the actual merit it deserved.

Hey, Thanks, Hollywood, for flushing your refuse into young male minds. Ka-ching. How much more violent and sadistic will such films have to be in the future to make that cash register sing? Let's up the ante.The Plot? Heath Ledger puts on a ridiculous series of ticks, costumes and make-up and tries really hard to get taken seriously as a master criminal / master actor. There is no real performance there because there is no real life there. In one scene, Ledger, a slight young man, murders a very large, muscular, professional criminal, and a black man \u0096 white supremacists will like that part \u0096 with a pencil. No. In real life that would not happen. Nor, in real life, would a man who shoots his every accomplice be able to do pull off any of the stunts ledger does in this film.The movie is utterly implausible. This won't matter to its fans, who talk only to other fans who worship films like this as they do. In their solipsistic, computer-generated echo chamber, \"The Dark Knight\" is the greatest film ever made. These fans have little contact with anyone not exactly like themselves, and can't see any flaws in their judgment. Though saturated in violence, these fans can't even see why a skinny guy like Ledger murdering a muscular, hardened criminal with a pencil is a silly, nasty, scene that exists only to up the sadism ante, not to have any relationship with reality. Though saturated in violence, these fans would panic at the merest contact with the real world, with the real violence occurring in places like Iraq, or federal prisons.Christian Bale is an interesting actor and was fun to watch in the previous batman. He's hardly on screen here. There is nothing interesting about the sets or costumes, and as for the special effects, how many chase scenes and big explosions have been on screen recently? Nothing new. Nothing interesting. The intelligent viewer will move along, or simply select a better film."

Before mentioning anything about The Dark Knight itself I should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore, it was (and I hope it still is) art. If you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies (starting from the early 1900s) then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing, cinematography, acting and \"special effects\" are fascinating. They are modern, sincere, effective, touching. That's where art starts and flourishes. However, if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects, deafening soundtrack, good looking actors, banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of Good vs Bad; well, here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system. The Dark Knight fits exactly the formula. Nothing more to say. To those who agree: There are still some great new movies coming out. It just takes time to find them. Don't be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films. To those who disagree: Well, consider watching Casablanca, Silence of the Lambs, Amadeus, Star Wars :p, etc? To those who don't take a side: Now is the time to do so. To Heath Ledger: You were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you. [17 June 2009]Later ... Here now as I watched the film for a second time so that I would be entirely fair in my judgment I realized that 8/10 is a fair rating BUT and only BUT when The Dark Knight is rated on a different scale such as \"Top movies based on a comics\". And what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot, good vs evil, black and white characters, lots of action? The end. When a movie has nothing more to add - no fair character development/acting, no original twists in the chain of events, no unique directing techniques... then one cannot give it more than 5/10. And since the IMDb has a great image the only way users can help keeping it safe and sound is by taking a little more seriously their voting rights. [30 June 2009]"

        "Context": "Review of one of the most surprising let downs follows. There are no spoilers, the film spoils itself enough...It's fair to say that prior to this film coming out I had concerns over the use of the Joker in this film. Concerns that only got more pronounced when I'd heard they cast Health Ledger in the role. Then I saw Brokeback Mountain and I became convinced that actually the guy had a raw talent and that maybe, just maybe, he could pull it off. Until the trailer came out and I was immediately concerned again. So how was Heath? Neither good nor bad. He was a live wire, and gleefully unpredictable and a shambolic, almost serpentine presence at points. But it wasn't spectacular. Talks of post-humous Oscar nods though are an exceptional exaggeration and unfortunately I believe this to be motivated by grief for Ledger.Aaron Ekhart's not bad, but I'm not really sure anyone knew why he was really there. I did NOT believe in Harvey Dent. Maggie Gyllenhaal was awful. It is a terrifying thing to say that Katie Holmes was better. You actually have your fingers crossed that someone will kill her right from the start. Morgan Freeman has a couple of nice moments but despite being given more screen time he contributes very little. Same with Gary Oldman. Seriously - what happened? Even Christian Bale seems to have lost a sense of what he's doing, Batman's voice getting ever closer to sounding like Rod Stewart's singing voice that at times I couldn't take it seriously, assuming you can make out what he's saying at all! It's difficult to comprehend that the same cast is in this film and Batman Begins, they really don't stack up side by side at all. Everone feels wasted.The Dark Knight is over long, it takes forever to really get any momentum going and then at the point you think it's starting it fails to launch. There are set pieces that don't really hang together and if you think about any of them for too long (which you will, as it does tend to drag) you'll find that they don't all make sense. One of the things that made Batman Begins so strong was a sense of realism - even going to great lengths to try to rationalize the ridiculous (a man dressed as a bat....). Tragically, The Dark Knight seems to have forgotten this entirely. Yes the Joker is larger than life but does that explain the obviously CGI enhanced stupid moments such as the Bat Pod cycling up a wall to flip over? There are too many of these moments - turning every cell phone into a sonar transponder in order to trace the Joker. Um? What? Also EVERYONE felt very written. Everyone's dialogue seemed to be furthering the plot rather than sounding like anything approaching reality. Michael Cain turns into Aunt May giving twee and convenient platitudes and nothing else - there's no sense of connection between him and anyone else. Gyllenhaal - even managing to leave twee and convenient letters to be read at twee and convenient moments. Aaron Ekhart seems to basically behave like a character bio rather than feeling terribly real and the whole descent into Two-Face thing STILL doesn't work.If you loved Batman Begins (and I did) you won't love this I'm afraid. You may not hate it, but I don't think you'll be impressed. I hope to watch this again at some point when the let down has passed me by and I'll hopefully enjoy it a bit more. There are three recent films I've been to see I had low expectations for - Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and The Dark Knight. The first two surprised me and exceeded my expectations. The latter has left me feeling a bit flat. I'm just very disappointed, Batman Begins set a very high mark. The Dark Knight by comparison is almost worth avoiding."

On the other hand, if there's a serious message in The Dark Knight, I missed it, as I suspect will thousands of others. As a Batman flick, it simply doesn't deliver anything like the expectations; at yet another level as a post-9/11, human-condition, search-for-identity movie it also fails - however you want to see it, it fails on a grandiose scale.For some of who do not live in the in the US, The Dark Knight has the potential to appear as little more than an appalling piece of hyped-up propaganda for a moribund social policy that permits and legitimises evil, mayhem and general wrongdoing and unpleasantness on a colossal scale in the pursuit of defeating the threats against society.I've had more fun at the cinema studying the architecture."

I think they re-cut the movie after Heaths death, to put him in the foreground.2. The movie is tooooo long, this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes, its like they couldn't choose what to put in, so they just put all of it in! This gave me and some of my friends several *yawn* moments near the end.3. Gotham city looks like a normal city. In \"batman begins\" it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesn't, which is a shame really.4. The point of the movie, (i wont tell u what it is) but yes, this action movie tries to make a philosophical point. Of course this can be great, but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat.5. Lack of humor. An occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great, however the dialogs arnt very good and they're never funny.6. The plot devices are really quite lame. I wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless, even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that. Somehow the movie doesn't manage to convince the audience of its own logic, probably cause there is none.All in all its a fun movie, with great performance by Heath as the joker, however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into. It doesn't deserve a place in the top 250, and it is not the best movie of 2008. Of course, if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you!"

This film is not the sixth best film of all time. Maybe near the bottom of that list. Christan Bale was a little over the top, and while I think Heath Ledger was great in his role, this movie was a little long. I started looking at my watch after about an hour and 45 minutes. Go ahead, hate on me, but this is my opinion. I think the reason there is so much hype on this film is that Mr. Ledger, may he rest in peace, died before the film came out. Aside from his performance, along with some flashes of brilliance out of Aaron Eckhart, it was a good film. And, from the people calling this the greatest comic book movie ever, I still say go look at Spiderman 2. That is the best comic book/superhero movie of all-time, with Superman 2 a close second."

        "Rating": 1,
        "Context": "I was expecting to see at least a semi-good movie but this film is not even up to par. This film gets a 1 rating from me because it tries to depict Batman and fails miserably at it. Even for an action movie if Batman hadn't been in it, it's not good. The plot is horrid and morbid, the amount of gore unhealthy and the fight sequences are badly done. Notable problems:A. What is this rock theme music that's constant in the movie? It comes whenever a suspense scene starts and sounds like an annoying electric guitar. What is this doing in a Batman film? Also, the plot seems to be totally disconnected in between scenes. The entire movie is like one big mishmash of 10 different stories that occur in succession. It is also unrealistic many times. In the beginning The Joker simply takes his schoolbus into the convoy to escape. And the way he avoids police in broad daylight and blows up the hospital is unbelievable.B. The Joker in this film is someone with a predilection for violence and violence alone. Traditionally, The Joker has been a nefarious, insane character. He does things that are out of kilter with normalcy. He then laughs at what he does and takes unexpected delight in it. This Joker is not like so. He's simply a disturbed psychopath who likes to blow up things and harm others. There's no depth to the character.C. Harvey Dent has been traditionally Black the last 2 decades. That and the way he's made into Two-Face in this movie is totally wrong. Two-Face traditionally goes on to become a crime boss but in this movie, he simply dies soon after coming into being. He also isn't a good Two-Face, overusing his coin flip to make decisions. For example, in the limousine scene he flips the coin again and kills the driver in order to eliminate a crime boss. The real Two-Face wouldn't have cheated like this once the coin makes a decision for him.D. Batman himself doesn't appear much in the movie. We are shown glimpses of him and the fight scenes are very darkly lit so it's hard to see who and how he's fighting. His over-reliance on technology is also not good because Batman usually uses wits as well as brawn. The voice of Batman is guttural sounding and Bruce Wayne himself doesn't seem to have any emotions. Micheal Keaton's portrayal of Batman in Batman (made in 1989) is by far the best in all movies.The Dark Knight is not just not a good Batman film. It's a poor film in any genre. I recommend watching Batman (1989) if one wants to see an excellent Batman film. Here's a small sample from this great movie that's better than the entire The Dark Knight:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC249jPbBDY"

Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather.This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledger's death had more of an impact on this movie's critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bale's obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw.The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. It's ridiculous.The best movie of 2008 is In Bruges, not TDK."

The Dark Knight seems to have been made by a pretentious man (a pretentious crew, at most). The major lacks of the movie is a dense scenario with no rhythm and no emotional implication and a flabby direction. After the two third of the movie, I was actually blunted and the only thing that I wanted to see was \"The End\" on the screen. Because I didn't care of the fate of the batman or the commissioner Gordon or Harvey Dent and because the story slacks from the beginning to the end. I don't think that Nolan was the good choice for such a movie, and excepting the early 90's McTiernan, I can't see what director would now be good enough to make this ambitious movie. Hiring a talented script-writer wouldn't have been bad for the sake of the movie, and a director who knows the making of good action scenes (but not like the bad Michael Bay). Nevertheless, The Dark Knight has some qualities : the actors are good, particularly Heath Ledger, and it's better than nothing."

That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining.

If \"Twister\" 1996 came out now a days there would be 300k people voting in 3 days and giving it an 8.6 rating (still to high at 6.0, but the movie wasn't very old when IMDb started up).2) Review...I couldn't finish watching \"The Dark Knight\". I tried earlier this year and then again the other night. It was horrible..... Let's start with the actors shall we...Ken dolls trying to act; a \"cough-cough\" not very attractive leading lady; and, of course, the highly overrated, yet not all that terrible, performance from Heath Ledger. Let's face it, anyone who saw \"Batman\" 1989 could see the rip off with Ledger's Joker. Michael Caine as Alfred???? Could you take him seriously as Alfred after seeing him in Austin Powers. The Chinese bad guy was the best actor in the movie...Are you starting to understand how bad this is yet?!I just can't go into how poor the story elements are too much. I'll get a migraine. Example: The prosecutor punches the witness and then takes a gun off someone, pulls it apart and then leaves it in front of the defendant. No, I didn't oversimplify it. I didn't leave something out. It's really that stupid. The rest of the movie (at least as far as I got) is also that bad. I think that's all I need to say. There's just no point in going on. I'll just add the one positive aspect...The effects are top notch. 3) Summary...Money, hype, dead actor hype, special effects, blah blah blah. You know the drill.

At some point I started to ask myself a question \"Why\".

Even though I would like to write 3 or 4 for it, I decided to give those extra minus points in the name of some disoriented cinema spectator, who thought it to be perfect. Just beside Shindler's list and Pulp Fiction? Are you serious?To sum it up - I would advise all those that praise Dark Knight, have a few hours lecture about history of cinema. They might be surprised, what genial directors are capable of. I would suggest starting with Kubric, Tarkovsky, Copolla, Lynch... And after the lecture adjust their evaluation scale accordingly."

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine join the cast as regulars, with guest stars in each installment as villains or temporary females. I watched the previews for these films and never had any desire to watch them. To me, Michael Keaton is Batman, and no remake can ever compare. My brother practically forced me to watch The Dark Knight, after Heath Ledger won his posthumous Oscar, and even though he raved and raved, I remained unimpressed. To me, the Batman films aren't supposed to be that dark and disturbing. Batman originated in a comic book, and should therefore be accessible to children. Nolan's imagination of Gotham City does not keep in view of the original comic or previous adaptations. It has the same feel of the types of films that specialize in serial killers.My brother raved about Christian Bale's American accent. I'd heard him show his talent at accents in other films, so this gravelly-voiced performance didn't terribly impress me. The villains\u2014Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow\u2014were needlessly frightening and relied on gimmicks rather than acting. Heath Ledger's untimely death was extremely tragic, but his performance in this film didn't warrant a nomination, let alone an Oscar win. He had a lot of makeup on, spoke in a different accent, and flicked his tongue in and out so audiences would think he's insane. The tongue flick is as old a trick in the book as it is to chew gum when playing a bimbo.There are extended action sequences that showcase vast special effects, so if you only watch movies based on how impressive the special effects are, you will probably want to rent this one. And, to be honest, younger audiences will probably really enjoy the reboot of the series. They didn't grow up watching it as originally intended, and today's audiences have short attention spans that need to be sensationalized every few minutes. Older folks who liked the Michael Keaton movies should stay far away from these.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Everything else is a disappointment.Christian Bale -- Could somebody please wake him up. Heath Ledger -- \"De mortuis, nihil nisi bonum.\" He avoided the snarling giggles of Nicholson and Romero and is a bit funny now and again, but I do not remember the Joker being a sado-masochist. The character remains a cartoon villain. Michael Caine -- An eighty year old butler. Pathetic. Sorry to say, but they really needed a younger man for the part. Script. -- a half decent first draft. Three or four more drafts and it might have amounted to something. With the exception of Dent, none of the characters are worth caring about. That's its major flaw. Production -- Dazzlingly cruddy. All the sets and props underwhelm. No real style is established. Cinematography -- Only one nice shot in the movie, when the Joker blows up a hospital. It is nice, but not great and only marginally memorable. Every other shot looks like a cheesy CBS crime show.I'm glad I waited until the last week of its run in the $2 movie theaters to see it. I would have hated to think I wasted $10 on this. I won't be getting the DVD. Please, do not give it to me for Christmas.I once got fired from a newspaper for giving a bad review to Tim Burton's \"Batman\". In retrospect, every \"Batman\" has been worse since then. Burton's first \"Batman\" is looking better and better all the time. I should mention that the film fails to establish meaning in its narrative. It constantly strives to do this by having the characters speak in deep voices and intone such nonsensical lines as \"If you stay around long enough, either you die a hero or end up a villain.\" By saying such trite nonsense in serious tones, you don't make the movie serious, only seriously trite and nonsensical.I was bored after the first half hour and the next two hours seemed like three or four, as I hoped, in vain, the movie would become interesting."

        "Context": "I'm downrating this movie strongly in response to the unbelievable amount of positive hype it's gotten (objectively I'd rate it a 4). I'm usually easy to please with movies; I loved Batman Returns. But \"Dark Knight\" was badly screwed up, IMO. What a pity. Pros: the acting was excellent (Ledger gives an all-out performance), and the visuals were great. Cons: some people have described this as a horror movie. But it's a horror movie without a good plot, without heroes, and without any emotionally satisfying defeat of the horror. Plot's a mess. Script was written by the director and his brother. It feels like the two pontificated and out-clevered themselves into writing a script that 1) tries to crams in *way* too much material and 2) feels awkward, meandering, preachy, and more interested in ideas than in characters or stories. No coherent storyarc; pacing is wrong. About halfway through the movie, there's a big death scene that in any other movie would have been part of the movie climax. But here, it's just another in an ongoing string of disasters. You have no idea where the movie's going after that; it devolves into one threat/action scene after another. Movie goes on far too long (people were muttering thru the last half, in my theater) and then just -- stops. No sense of triumph or closure; just another limp failure. One guy behind me said, \"Well, whatever. I need a beer.\" Characterization was screwed. Multiple characters did things that made no sense logically in the story, or for their established personality. Because dialogue depends on decent characterization \u0096 much of the dialogue sucked. The romance elements? Yawn. Interpersonal relationship and conversational insights into characters? Double yawn. The heroes are shown as failures -- flustered, outmaneuvered, emotionally and morally bankrupt. Yeah, I want moral complexity in a superhero movie \u0096 but it also helps if the heroes are sometimes allowed to be, you know, heroes. Overall recommendation: worth seeing for the acting and visuals, but plot and characterization stink."

Pause and think about that character for a minute.\n\"The Batman\" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is \"the Joker\", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc"

It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling.

        "Context": "Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Bu\u00f1uel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

        "Context": "Have you ever felt like waking up from a dream to see its continuation? This idea disturbs Christopher Nolan ever since he was 16. Already in the future, as he developed this idea in his head, he was visited by another captivating feeling. And what if it were possible to study and manage the place of sleep? Now the British cinematographer is 39 years old, and the world has finally come to the opportunity to get to know what Nolan was so stunning, fast and loud all these years. \"The Beginning\" is a sci-fi thriller about the architecture of the mind. If for some reason this has not yet become a reason for the strongest intrigue, it is never too late to recreate it.Philosophy of Nolan. It is simple and at the same time terrifyingly exceptional. Making your environment think like you. To share all the events happening together. Experiencing the same difficulties. Strive to hold together for the hands to achieve the impossible. Making unusual things happen in the usual way. The topic can be continued, and its brief description will remain unchanged. Any person with whom you work, whether an actor or someone else, will always be completely imbued with the material that you yourself wrote, if this material is perceived by every person at the deepest personal level.Fans of the series \"LOST\" could have done the same thing with \"Star\" as they did with every series of the popular, now in the old days, series. Probably, for a reason, at the end of the day, a percentage of people will be drawn, what from wild ecstasy after watching will obviously lose consciousness in the most positive sense? The name of the film company Nolan \"Syncopy\" from the ancient Greek era means the medical term of fainting, loss of consciousness. I'm not talking about plot similarities with the term. And the logo of his film company, whose foundation happened in the year 99, has absolutely identical design as the \"Start\" screensaver. In the picture, the characters Paige and DiCaprio get acquainted in the same place where Nolan once met his future wife and constant working partner. And this is not all \"Easter eggs\".\nFrom the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the snowy peaks of Calgary, from the exoticism of the Moroccan Tangier to the picturesque streets of Paris, from historic London to modern-day Los Angeles. The scale that Nolan saw from the emotional journey of his painting could not fit in a modest framework, so the shooting process affected 4 continents and 6 so different countries.To make the dreams look as real as possible, the director once again followed his eternal principle and tried to maximally abandon computer graphics. Whether it's a revolving corridor 30 meters long built in Cardington, or the busiest street in Paris, mass explosions are caused by nothing else than nitrogen under high pressure. Impressive buildings in the Canadian Calgary provided work for thousands of local residents for six months. Their efforts could not justify themselves fully due to the fact that on approaching the crew to the place of direct filming, for a long time there was not much needed snow. He \"fell out\", creating for the creators is another problem due to the fact that did not stop a very long period. Arriving in early August in Morocco, a big unexpected success for the creators was the acquaintance with the local team, with whose help Hollywood partially took off more than one blockbuster in the territory of this African country. And the street traffic of Los Angeles was cleaned by the railroad train, behind the wheel of which was everyone's favorite Jim Wilkie. The same guy who ran an eighteen wheeled wagon in the \"Dark Knight\". This is only a small part of what the \"Beginning\" shakes.DiCaprio amazes us with one of the most difficult characters of recent times, which is largely due to the care and personal affection that Leo showed to Cobb. Together with Marion Cotillard, they create a screen couple capable of enveloping the soul of any viewer. I've never seen anything like it and close. The talented Hollywood youth in the faces of Page and Gordon-Levitt demonstrate a full understanding of the color range and levels of brightness of the characters assigned to them. Tom Hardy, performing the imitator, brought to the picture a significant share of charisma. And Killian Murphy finally embodied an image that has long been very curious to him. In May 2009, Nolan offered him absolutely any role, and he chose the \"Client\". And Ken Watanabe ... As in the case with the other images, we all will long try to disassemble this character, which is a very important and charismatic question for us. Each of his actors, Nolan asked not to tell anything about the plot, even to their families.Quite symbolic is the fact of the presence in the film of the song of Edith Piaf. After all, for the image of Edith Piaf in the film \"Life in pink\" in 2007, Marion Cotillard received a statuette of Oscar for Best Actress. Hans Zimmer paid close attention to the creation of the track, not so much to the stunning visual component of the picture, but to the emotional world of the main characters. It's always evident when Hans is captured by the storyline of the picture for which he is going to work, and \"Beginning\" is no exception. Filling the rich sensory undercurrent on the screen with a wonderful musical series, Hans did not leave behind his own imagination, allowing himself to go beyond the usual framework in the hope of looking where they would lead him. From here came the guitar, played on which none other than Johnny Marr of the band \"The Smiths\".\nFor any of us, there is a difference in choice, when deciding whether it is worth chasing us for a happy moment or total happiness as such? Also here. Despite the speed with which you develop on the screen a completely different action - you want to keep up with it. Our feelings are awakened in the most active ways because of the resource that causes in us a similar instinct to comprehension and further awareness. This tape is a symbol of the whole structure of our everyday perception of what surrounds us in the material and immaterial world. A symbol that is itself the architect of a bridge connecting two opposite sides.Incredible and colossal, difficult-procedural result of the most outstanding artistic production in all spheres of film production. A movie that will never leave your mind, demanding from you its regular revision. The movie, which you will discover with each new show for yourself in a new way. A mad, multi-level, impressive plot production, attached to the deepest actor images. Infinitely rich semantic context and visual component. All this is a combination of the greatest cinematic experience that Nolan dragged through all these years. He would never have become a director of N1 in the modern world if he were not true, loving his family by a man. And this is the most important thing. That - with what all \"Begins\" ...A rare dream that survived so many years ...Film of the Decade."

        "Rating": 9,
        "Context": "Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time Not that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues. Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie."

Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. \"Memento\", \"The Prestige\", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it's best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don't mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say \"Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that.\". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with \"Avatar\". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn't make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first \"Matrix\", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like \"Kindergarden Cop\". No disrespect to \"The Matrix\" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.And that's all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in \"Memento\", and you certainly see it in action with \"The Prestige\"......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.But that's where Nolan's true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that's what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen."

        "Rating": 10,
        "Context": "What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards"

My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"

        "title": " Nolan at his most intelligent best.\n",
        "Rating": 10,
        "Context": "Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."

The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending."

        "Context": "Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"

Thete is a danger in this freedom and strctureless whole that opens the door to chaos. This film sabotages all genres. It demolishes mind states.

And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather. And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh."

This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book \"The Power of Movies\", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. \"Inception\" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and \"Dark Knight\") as good examples of what ruined the country. Wretched excess."

What an absolute waste of money! After reading the other user reviews, I can't help but wonder if we didn't watch a completely different film. All science fiction films require a suspense of reality as they are based on a future time, feature incredible technology which is currently beyond our reach, etc. Given that, most films try to put this aspect into some kind of context which makes the central premise believable or possible. Not in this case. This film's plot vehicle is something called is 'shared dreaming,' through which a third-party can access your dreams and unlock information you are keeping secret. It is somehow done by connecting the dreamers up to a devices contained in stylish briefcases and then - POW - they are in an apparent instant REM state, all connected together and journeying off in their dream world. Huh? It's just thrown out there and the audience is expected to just absorb the concept, accept it and move on to be wowed by all the special effects. A murmur of 'I don't get it' was heard throughout the theater I was in.Early in the film Dicaprio approaches a student played by Ellen Page, who is a student of his old professor and asks her to be an 'architect' and design his dream environments for him. The environments must have mazes and paradoxes. Now, most folks when presented with such a concept would be calling the nut house on a guy like Dicaprio, but Page's character just accepts the whole thing and dives in, having a whee of a time with the environment she creates, bending it and reforming it in visually impressive ways. There is no attempt, however, to sell this whole thing to the audience and it just doesn't work in any sort of context. As the team descends through layers of 'levels' of dreams, the whole thing just becomes more moronic and boring. Great visuals, lots of action, but it all just seems pointless.I would put this down as one of the worst movies I've ever seem. Beautifully shot, but with an empty, stupid plot."

Haven't you people seen the anime film, \"Paprika?\" And what about \"The Matrix\"? Those movies, to me, did a MUCH BETTER job in dealing with the concept of dreams and the distortion between them as far as what exactly ARE dreams and what exactly IS reality? IMHO, \"INCEPTION\" was a mess. To me, and to a lot of other people, it was ambiguous just for the sake of being ambiguous.Just one of my many beefs about this movie was that dreams should be amorphic. People's faces, backgrounds, should've been somewhat distorted or at least a little blurry. Things should not have been so artfully contrived. Most if not ALL dreams, are not so well crafted or constructed down to the last detail. All we got with \"INCEPTION\" was falling buildings??! Really? There was NOTHING dream-like about ANY of those scenes. Even when Ellen Page \"oh-so-perfectly\" designed, maneuvered and constructed bridges and mirrors and other crap. Gimme a break! Everything was just WAAAYY too convenient and perfectly timed down to the minute. And what the hell is \"LIMBO\"??? What, we're all just supposed to accept this kind of blatantly crappy inexplicable science-fiction?And even though some things don't always HAVE to be explained, the mystery surrounding the dream \"device\" and that dream \"drug\" wasn't all that interesting. I was able to suspend my disbelief in movies like \"Paprika\" and \"The Matrix\" because not only were those story lines just way more cohesive(as far as story arcs are concerned), I was also given enough exposition to actually CARE about some of the characters.

Nolan is one of the most overrated directors out there, and this movie is just another vehicle for his enormous ego to perpetuate the notion that he's a genius when he's really a hack. He may have some really good ideas and concepts, but he SUCKS on his follow through. He knows how to generate the hype machine, which makes people feel like, if they didn't \"get\" or \"like\" one of his movies, then they're not part of the really \"cool\" and \"in\" sub-culture of our times. Just like with TDK, which I think was and still is THE most overrated movie of our time.Don't buy into the hype. Stop letting ol' Nolan boy pull the strings. If one of his movies sucks, then it sucks. There's nothing at all wrong, uncool or apocryphal about that. It just IS. And this DID.And come on, people!

It insults me, because it's made for elementary school kids, uses their language, verbally explains every step like in the mute films of the twenties, and pretends to be a high class entertainment for smart people. Yesterday I watched 4 or 5 European and South American movies. None of them had budget higher than 15 million dollars. Inception doesn't worth even a tenth of the worst of them with its 160 million dollar budget. Apart from the special effects I don't see anything good in it. Acting is bad, dialogue is worse, and entertainment is zero. I was actually forcing myself watching and waiting to see the point of all this... Couldn't bear anymore when my watch showed that 50 minutes have passed. And I love Science Fiction movies. I even from time to time enjoy watching a B rate movies, which make you relax and give you 2 hours of entertainment away from everyday stress.

Got that after a minute or so of viewing. And then what? It feels too much like a storm in a teacup.Frederic Dard (french novelist) used to describe futuristic gadgets by means of expressions like \"he's pointing a gloombobber with spiral condensing palchromium in my direction\" but, being a talented writer, he had the good taste of limiting such eccentric nonsense to a single sentence per book, whereas Inception is made up of nothing but that from beginning to end. Each time the dream-team runs into a potential nag, there comes a gloombobber out of a hat. Too predictable after a while. \"This can't be done in a three-dimensional space... no problem, we'll do it in seven!\" would be an adequate tag-line for Inception.I couldn't follow the storyline and am not convinced there actually was one. It reminded me of the Brownian movement observed at the surface of a pot of boiling water. It was so confusing that switching actors every two minutes for the part of the main character would have gone unnoticed in this maelstrom of nonsensical garbage.In conclusion I don't see any point in watching Inception unless you're extremely high on speed or a fan of special effects who doesn't give a whoopdeedo about well-constructed stories in the first place."

But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film.This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb.

        "Context": "A shame that this movie is rated so highly on IMDb. Let me tell you this, this movie is NOT a masterpiece and doesn't even deserved to be among the top 250 of the best movie of all time. A true masterpiece has to be flawless and this movie is worth at most 5.8, no more. The neuro-nonsense that follow suit from a scientific and a philosophical point of view, Inception doesn't make any sense at all...Inception must start with a self-consistent theory of how the human brain works. What is a memory? What is a dream? Because most of us human beings walk around with only very fuzzy answers to these questions, filmmakers are able to take rather outlandish positions on them without arousing any hackles.In the case of Inception, the unstated premise of dreaming is that one one is asleep, one is inhabiting what essentially amounts to a parallel reality external to the mental state of the dreamer. This premise makes for an admittedly entertaining film, but it is preposterous. Dreaming is an entirely subjective experience; everything is an illusion generated and perceived by the brain itself. You can no more \"enter\" someone else's dream than you can enter into a movie that's playing on the multiplex screen.If you \"wake up\" from a dream and realize that you're still dreaming, you haven't entered a different level of some dream-reality continuum -- you've just experienced another illusory sensation. Contrary to the premise of the film, there is no \"architecture\" of a dream. We may feel like we're inhabiting an elaborate, detailed and consistent landscape, but that's just part of the illusion. There are some ideas about dreaming in the film that are actually accurate. For instance, it's true that they are powerfully influenced by emotion and subconscious cognition. And we often do wake ourselves with a powerful muscle spasm, which sleep researchers call a \"hypnic jerk.\" But the movie also trades in ideas that amount to little more than folklore. It toys with the old idea that if you die in your dream, you will also die in real life.In the movie, if you die in your dream, you will enter a kind of coma. For obvious reasons, there is no evidence for bangungut-like phenomena, or rather any evidence has gone with the dreamers to their graves.What about the idea that time slows down within a dream, that an elaborate sequence of events in dream-space can take place in a few seconds of real time? As it happens, this claim has been investigated by researchers exploring lucid dreaming, and the results indicate that if there is any such effect, it is fairly small. Okay, but does any of this matter? Scientific error is rife in popular entertainment.I'm prepared to argue that Inception's misconceptions are both symptomatic and enabling of a damaging confusion that is rife in American society: namely, that between the internal subjective reality within our minds and the external, universally accessible reality of the \"real world.\" It is this confusion that give rise to magical thinking and its myriad manifestations, from prayer-healing to \"The Gift\" and mystical notions about near-death experiences.Confusion about the boundary between dream and reality is particularly endemic among the religiously inclined, who often perceive dreams as the source of real-world information. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel, for instance, is located on a spot identified in a dream by the Emperor Constantine's mother, Helena.The perfect metaphor of this movie would be like this:\"I liked it,\"\"I didn't really understand what was going on, but I liked it.\"A tad overrated movie that need to be drop out of the top 250 movies list of all time. I'll give him 2 stars for the CGI effects who were indeed well done. That is all."

        "Rating": 2,
        "Context": "I'm trying very hard to be fair here. Given my high expectations and all the praise, it's hard not to bite back. So I'll temper my initial review (\"Sitting through Inception was more disappointing and more frustrating than discovering my first girlfriend was cheating on me\") with this one: \"Inception buried everything that I might have loved about it 10 feet under things that were terrible.\"What I hoped for: Dreaming as an exploration of character, plumbing the depths of people's imagination to discover their secrets and find out who they truly are. Dreaming as journey through fantasy: impossible landscapes, surreal physics. Something that might exist at the intersection of The Matrix, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and August Strindberg's A Dream Play.And I trusted Nolan to deliver. In Memento and The Prestige, he gave himself a unique set of rules for telling a story and used them magnificently. In his Batman films, he found humanity amid tense action and explored deeper themes than you usually expect from a franchise blockbuster.What we got: Exposition, exposition, exposition, bad action, bad action, bad action, wisps of story (and mostly the wrong story). Oh, and a lot of decently talented actors who never stopped being decently talented actors to become their characters (by my count, only two people had any motivation for their actions).I've been asleep before so I didn't expect to need a primer on dreaming. But no, movie dreaming is full of rules. Roughly the first hour of Inception is dedicated to cataloging these: what happens when you die, how much time passes while you dream (mind you it changes when you have a dream inside a dream), differences between imagined and remembered places, the types of sedatives you need, how you know you're asleep, etc etc etc.This becomes especially frustrating because many of the dream physics are quickly superseded by different dream physics. For instance, we're first told one thing happens when you die in a dream (which is important to establish a character's motivation), but then later we're told something else entirely will happen (because the movie would have had even less sense of danger if dying wasn't bad for our protagonists). Not only that, but some of these dream rules are nothing but Chekhovian peashooters- existing only to set up a single action later in the film.To be completely fair, bits of this exposition take place against the backdrop of a gorgeous and surreal dreamscape (one of only two moments where dreaming feels magical).Where was that sense of surreal dream non-reality distinctly lacking? The action sequences, which account for another hour of the movie.There are two ways, in my estimation, to make action scenes exciting. The first one requires you to make the audience genuinely uncertain whether the protagonists can prevail. This is no easy task. Usually, it necessitates breaking narrative conventions so your audience can't figure out the plot points in advance. If we're at the one hour mark and a couple armed goons pop up, then you've got to work damn hard to convince me they can actually hurt the protagonist. Maybe you had a different experience with Inception, but I never held my breath when the guns came out.The second way to make action scenes worthwhile is to make the action itself so damn fun or engrossing that the audience doesn't care if it can predict the ending. I know Bruce Lee is going to win his fight, but I'll watch it for the choreography. I've seen Wesley outfence Inigo a dozen times, but the quips could fuel dozens more viewings. There's no question that Axe Cop is going to kill the bad guys, but did I expect him to do it by hurling a baby with a unicorn horn? No. No I did not.This is one of the failures of Inception for me. There's so much combat, but it all devolves into tired clich\u00e9s (with the notable exception of some of Gordon-Levitt's scenes- the only other moment where I experienced anything dream-like). I always felt that the writers failed to exploit the infinite creative possibility available to characters like Neo and Hal Jordan, but dodging bullets and firing green blobs seems downright inspired next to Nolan's dream goons with their AK-47s.So one hour of exposition, one hour of bad action, what's left? Half an hour of story or, rather, two stories. One story is about a business man wanting to steal from another business man in a convoluted way. Or something. I didn't care because the business men lacked any motivation and they kept getting in the way of what should have been the only story: unraveling Cobb's secrets.What might have been: I've hated movies before and I'm not normally inclined to write reviews for them. So what's different here? Well, it's frustration that this could have been amazing when it was truly awful.The premise has legs- sturdy, exciting legs. Dreaming is often a magical experience. Lucid dreaming, when it happens, is even more magical, giving your rational brain the freedom to play in an irrational world. Lucid dreamers sharing a dream? Fantastic. Lucid dreamers trespassing in dreams with weaponized imaginations? I don't know how you could ruin that premise.And there was the kernel of something good in there- not just hallway good, but really damn good. I cared about Cobb's story. I wanted to watch Cobb's story. Unfortunately, two hours and fifteen minutes of terrible movie got in the way of Cobb's story."

        "Context": "Surely IMDb can survive without yet another amateur review for \"Inception\". I'm only doing this to justify myself about the 2 star rating. I would normally have rated this movie with 6 points. But as other reviewers state, I feel that is just fair to give a lower rate to balance a little the totally overblown rate it has. This film looks fantastic in Blu-Ray. There are several sequences that are a real visual delight (the Paris caf\u00e9 scene where Di Caprio's character is explaining the young dream architect portrayed by Ellen Page and the 0 gravity sequence in the second layer dream). But the problem is that beyond that you don't have much. Looks like Mr. Nolan sacrificed plot line and character developed for the technical aspects. The plot is not complex, is just convoluted. The characters are cardboard thin and underdeveloped. I never imagined dreams could be as uninteresting as in this movie. Have you ever watched Fellini's movies? Or Tartovsky's? or Cocteau's? or Bu\u00f1uel's? Plenty of dream-like images there \u0085 One last word: it's a pity to gather such fine actors and waste them as Mr. Nolan did here; Joseph Gordon Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Watanabe san do what they can with the script, but Leonardo DiCaprio can't do much to give some life to his character. An utterly uninvolving movie. I'll stay with Matrix if I want a Hollywood production dealing with a superficial questioning of our perception of reality and sub consciousness."

        "Context": "I saw it last week and really don't get the hype. OK, the idea is nice, but the movie itself is just like any other Mission Impossible of Oceans Eleven franchise. It is a boring heist movie. Apart from that the characters are lame. DiCaprio plays the same person as in Shutter Island and the action scenes are completely out dated. I thought I was Watching an Bond movie from the 80's from time to time. And why did they have to explain everything. I'm not stupid. Just a quick run through and we could have started. Nolan took over an hour to explain everything..... Why. No I also did not like Memento, so maybe Nolan's puzzles are not my cup of teaNo, this movie is not what I had hoped."

        "Context": "In a lifetime of watching movies, the hardest I had getting through a whole movie was one called \"The Sicilian\" (1987). That was until I saw \"Inception.\" The 148 minutes of sitting in my seat during its showing was worse than when I had a 16 hour flight to Australia with needles and pins running in my back and legs the whole way. Cillian Murphy is fabulous but our local high school could have supplied a better ensemble cast. The story was conceptually all right. But DiCaprio's headlining the movie helped to make it a disaster with his all of his excessive, over-dramatized, wide-eyed looks and theatrics. He's neither a sympathetic or interesting character. Put him in a suit, slick back his hair, and grow a little facial stubble, but he still looks like a teenager pretending to look like a grown up."

        "Context": "I respect the fact that I have a minority view of this film, the overwhelming majority of folks leaving such high praise in their comments. But boy, I found this so dull and I ended up really hating it. A pity, since I liked the concept and was looking forward to the film.The relentless force feeding of dramatic music and ugly-faced grimaces, attempting to give every scene in the film a weight it just didn't merit, was too much for me. Hardly a smile anywhere in this shockingly one-paced film and not a single character I could feel any warmth towards or empathy with. Complex without reason, lacking any hint of soul, riddled with cliched fight scenes, honestly - yuk! And for what - an ending that was predictable, cheesy and devoid of emotion.One star for being Chris Nolan, another for some interesting special effects. That's it."

        "Context": "The levels of boredom I reached during this film will take a fair while for me to forgive Christopher Nolan, the Director, for. A very simple idea has been taken and, just like my headphones do in my pocket, twisted and turned to leave me wondering how on earth they managed to get in this nonsensical situation. It's one saving grace, the CGI, has been used to try to endlessly distract the audience from the utter tripe being pass off as a story-line. I'm surprised that the distributors weren't legally obliged to provide the audience with an eye wash with their ticket, as the intense editing and camera movement left me, on several occasions, having to check my eyes weren't bleeding.Like The Matrix, it beggars belief that this film is being held up as some sort of future classic. Either I'm a genius, hovering in a state of advanced consciousness, or the people who loved this film are stoners or morons, unfortunately, for my ego, I suspect the later to be the reality.Save your money."

I didn't finish watching this overrated pile of nonsense as the 'soap opera' subplot made what ever ending was planned impossible to care about.Never ending 'staccato' of guns shooting in: Tibet, Paris, Los Angeles (passing for NYC), in cars, out of cars, in buildings - on and on.Worse was the wife of DiCapprio - if one is going to write a story make it engaging.I have to say the more I 'see' 'heavies' assaulting the public through brawls, shootings, threats - the more it looks like a short career choice based on declining ability and brains. True actors actresses understand the ubiquitous chase scenes and shoot em' ups are filler because a script can't be coherently portrayed. I lost interest after one hour and pulled the disc before hour two was about to begin."

        "Rating": 2,
        "Context": "I remember when they (and Chris Nolan) used to make films about people and their dilemma's. The actual conflict in Inception is just an after-thought to appease. Cobb's issue about wanting to see his children is so tired and played out it is almost laughable. With all the attention that went into the dream process, maybe Nolan could have spent a little more time with human elements of the film.Whether it's a wife who killed her children or a wife who killed herself and left children, we are tired of Leo as the grieving husband (Inception/Shutter Island). Clearly this film was to showcase cleverness in concept and effects. The story is a bare-bones, hackneyed joke.Even the mission is a yawner. Who cares about the rich kid and his rich dad- you don't even get to know them so why care? None of the relationships are below the surface so there is nothing invested in the story.Movies are about relationship, conflict and story. All of these elements are after-thoughts in INCEPTION! This is strictly a concept film whose execution of CGI is way more special then it's attention to story."

        "Context": "I really appreciate that the negative reviews for this film capture its most horrific quality: making people feel smart for understanding a stupid concept.If you showed this movie to a surrealist/dadaist, they would in fact find it incredible: how could so many people find this interesting, or even worth talking about? I've heard more inventive ideas from 5-year-olds than this.Do dreams even work like \"Inception\"? No. No. No. God no.This is a psychologist's nightmare. Is this also why the American public have such dreadfully low emotional intelligence? Yes, dreams could be free of things like physical laws, but they are so much more meaningful than \"wee, I can fly!\" Besides gravity, all laws of reality are broken in dreams: people morph into other people, or multiple people can be the same person at the same time, or you can be both yourself and another person. Your bedroom could be your bedroom at one moment, and then also become a prison cell at the same time - and even then, sometimes there's no notion of time at all! The point is that these \"images\", \"feelings\", \"characters\" are driven by emotion, or your brain finally being able to connect 2 things together without pesky reality getting in the way. \"The world is blue like an orange.\"Inception literally un-trains the viewer from relating to his/her dreams intelligently. Rendering the amazing experience of dreaming through film is a huge challenge, and so many directors have done it much better justice than this piece of garbage."

Overwrought, longgg, confusing and as much as I love Ken Watanabe could you have at least done a take or two where you could actually understand him? Yes, there are a few positives to this thing (Leo is almost always great, and Ellen Page is refreshingly for once not doing her \"Hard Candy\" role) but gawwwwd Chris Nolan is on his truly on his way to becoming the next Shyamalamadingdong.
